# CLAUDE.md

Softfall: a browser canvas 2D top-down pixel-art cozy survival team battle on a winter map — ten
players, two teams, drive off the rival eagle to win. **Read [docs/dev/game.md](docs/dev/game.md) before proposing
a feature or judging whether one fits**: that is the design in one page, and this file is only the
rules.

## Commands

```
node app/server.js          # static server + screenshot sink on http://localhost:8471
node app/bake-sfx.js       # audio/sfx/*.mp3 -> js/sfxdata.js; rerun after changing a clip
```

**Double-clicking [index.html](index.html) has to work** — nothing may depend on being served. A
`file://` page cannot `fetch` its own folder, which is why `app/bake-sfx.js` inlines the sound
effects (its output is committed); an asset loaded any other way is silently dead off the disk.
No package manager, dependencies, tests or linter: edit a `js/*.js` file and reload.

**Verify changes in the browser, not by re-reading code.** `window.DBG` (end of
[js/boot.js](js/boot.js)) stages a scene without playing to it, `?seed=N` pins the world,
`POST /shot` sinks the canvas, and **`.`** toggles hitboxes and routes:
[checklists](docs/dev/checklists.md#verifying-a-change).

## Deep docs

Read the relevant one **before** working in that area — they carry the detail this file omits.

## Architecture

Five legacy files — `profile.js`, `font.js`, `sprites.js`, the generated `sfxdata.js`,
`audio.js` — keep their IIFEs and expose fixed `window` globals; after them the game code is
**flat top-level classic scripts sharing one global scope** — twenty-five files, `core.js` through
`boot.js` (the tag `pre-split` keeps the one-file history).
[index.html](index.html) loads them in a fixed order and they communicate **only through
globals**, so each file's globals must exist before the next loads. The file table and the
shared-scope mechanism: [architecture](docs/dev/architecture.md).

**`js/profile.js` is the only file that touches `localStorage`** — the local player profile (name,
lifetime stats, which kinds it has ever held, and the settings that live under it). Everything else
goes through `PROFILE`, so putting the profile on a server stays a one-file change; never read or
write a storage key directly. **A match reads nothing back out of a profile**: the whole arsenal is
unlocked for everybody, so `LOOT_POOL` is the same on a first flight as on a five-hundredth
([the wiki](docs/dev/gameplay.md#the-wiki)).

All game state lives in module-scope singletons (`state`, `settings`, `players`) and the entity
arrays beside them; `player`/`inv` are the **local player only**, carried goods are `player.bag` and
the two meals are the uncapped `player.food` pouch — both reached only through the `bag*` helpers.
The full list: [code-map](docs/dev/code-map.md#jsplayerjs).

A feature's **tuning constants live in the file that owns the feature**, above the code that reads
them; `core.js` keeps only the numbers with no one owner. A const is invisible to files that load
before its own, so anything read at *load time* must be declared no later:
[architecture](docs/dev/architecture.md#the-game-files-corejs--bootjs).

The game code is organized only by `// ------ name` banners inside its twenty-five files.
**Keep every banner honest**, and find any function by its banner in
[docs/dev/code-map.md](docs/dev/code-map.md) — read it before grepping blind.

## Versioning

**Never commit to main.** Branch as `<name>/<topic>`, run `/sync` before every push, merge via PR.
The PR's last commit bumps `PATCH_TXT` ([js/menu.js](js/menu.js)) by 0.01 over origin/main and tops
`PATCH_NOTES` with one uppercase sentence; the commit message begins with the patch name
(`PATCH 2.11 — ...`), so `git log --oneline` reads as a build history.

## UI rule: show, don't label

**Communicate through visuals and visual indicators wherever possible; avoid lengthy text
explanations.** An icon beside a number, an arrow that is clickable, a colour that carries the
team, a plank that lifts on hover — not "CLICK OR ARROWS TO SWAP", not "PLAYERS LEFT: 5". A
control must read as what it does by its shape and its hover state alone, and if you catch
yourself writing a hint sentence, build the affordance instead. Text is for names, numbers,
headlines (a death, a landmark) and five deliberate carve-outs: **keybind indicators** (`'ESC
BACK'`, a "1" in a slot's corner — which wear the pad's button while one is in hand, `PAD_BIND`
in ui.js, so a new one goes through `drawKeyPrompt`/`drawPadBind`), the **settings, PLAYER, gear, character and shop panels**'
labelled rows, the **instruments** — the practice room's (the dummy meter, the parkour's lap
clock and the archery round's readouts, with their BEST / LAST plates) and the merchant's
(the two price graphs and their high/low) — because an instrument's whole job is comparing
numbers, and the **hover tooltip** (bottom-left,
`tipAt`/`drawTooltip`, ui.js) — which earns it because comparing a tool's rate of fire against a
bit's weight is comparing *numbers*, and no shape does that. It is a carve-out, not a licence: the
well still has to read at a glance without it. Anything else that wants words is a design bug.

## Hard rules

Cross-file invariants — breaking one produces a bug that looks unrelated to its cause. The test for
belonging here: **would you break it without ever having reason to open the deep doc?** If not, it
lives in `docs/dev/*.md` beside the code it protects.

- **Canvas size changed?** Call `fitCanvas()` **then** `relayout()` — both paths (window resize,
  `fullscreenchange`) do. Never write layout against a literal 480/270; the view is `VIEW_W`×`VIEW_H`.
- **Zoom scales the world, never the UI.** `render()` draws the world into `worldCv` at
  `WV_W`×`WV_H`, blits it in device px, then draws the UI in `VIEW_W`×`VIEW_H` under a `devScale`
  transform, so the HUD is one size at every zoom. A **world** pass bounds itself against `WV_*`;
  cross between spaces only through `mouseWX()`/`mouseWY()` and `wToSX()`/`wToSY()`.
- **The zoom the player rests at is a whole number of device px per world px** (`kWant`; the
  wheel steps it by 1). Anything that sets the zoom goes through that rung, or the pixel grid
  stops being uniform and sprites look stretched.
- **Screen position is `round(world − camera)`, rounded exactly once.** Statics subtract the
  rounded `ox`/`oy`; moving entities subtract the exact `ex`/`ey` and round at the end. Rounding
  camera and entity separately makes sprites vibrate ±1 px against the background while walking.
- **Text over the world uses `drawPixelTextOutline`** (a 1px dark rim on all sides, opaque colour);
  `Shadow` is for text on panels and planks, and for anything under a `globalAlpha` fade. White
  pixel text on white snow with only a drop shadow is unreadable.
- **Runtime ground change?** Call `repaintGround(tx, ty)` — it repaints the tile plus its four
  neighbours into the prerendered ground canvas. Never call `renderGround()` per frame; it bakes
  the entire 3712×3712 world and is a boot-time cost.
- **Nothing on the map emits light, and night is a colour, not a darkness** —
  [`renderLighting`](docs/dev/rendering.md#light-and-weather) grades the finished world frame, so
  a new glowing thing adds a pass there rather than registering anywhere.
- **Anything the weather moves reads `windSway(tx, ty)`**, never a clock of its own: one field
  (the `wind` banner, js/sim.js — waves summed on crossing bearings under a gust envelope) drives
  the snow and every pine's frame, and it dies at dusk.
- **A sprite the world holds hundreds of draws from ONE texture** — a `drawImage` whose source
  canvas differs from the last cannot be batched, and the pines measured 97 fps as sixteen
  canvases against 199 as one atlas: [rendering](docs/dev/rendering.md#drawing-a-thousand-of-something).
- **Units are solid to each other.** `separateUnits()` runs once per sim step after every mover has
  stepped; a new kind of thing that walks must join its list (and `UNIT_MASS`, and be marked `small`
  unless a roll should stop on it) or it walks through everyone. A player mid-roll is the exception:
  it skips contact with a small unit, because `rollSweep` turns that contact into a hit instead.
- **Every target picker asks `unitAlive(e)`** — the arrow loop, the roll's sweep,
  `unitsNear`/`unitsHit`, a turret's mark, a worker's quarry, the hunt reticle — so one answer
  takes a body out of *every* weapon at once; that is what makes a **merchant** untouchable.
- **Every living thing takes the same hit.** A blow goes through `hurtUnit(e, dmg, nx, ny, src, o)`
  and a state through its setter (`stunUnit`/`rootUnit`/`slowUnit`/`netUnit`/`markUnit`/`igniteUnit`,
  the `status effects` banner); an area effect sweeps `unitsNear`/`unitsHit`, never a loop per kind.
  Reaching for `damagePlayer` in a new ability is how wildlife and worker bots quietly stop being in
  the game: [gameplay](docs/dev/gameplay.md#status-effects-one-set-for-every-unit).
- **Anything that walks to a goal routes there** through `navTo`/`navStep` (the `pathfinding`
  banner), never by steering straight at it, and **drops the goal when they return `ok = false`**
  (no route, or pinned) — there are no stuck timers; a caller that ignores `ok` stands still forever.
  `navStep` is also where `unitMoveMul` is spent, so a hand-steered walk folds it in itself.
- **A loop over `players` that touches the world must skip `inAir(p)`** (riding or falling from the
  eagle) alongside `!p.active`/`p.dead` — arrows, drops, wildlife, the draw list and both maps all do.
- **Gold never goes straight into `p.inv.gold`** — every payout calls `gainGold(p, n)`, which is
  also the XP source; a direct `+=` earns no levels. One exception: `tradeGold`, the merchant's
  till — a sale is an exchange, and a counter that buys fish at its own asking price would
  otherwise be a level farm ([the counter](docs/dev/gameplay.md#the-merchants-counter)).
- **A tool is an instance, not a type name.** Its bag cell carries the bits loaded into it, so a
  tool is **moved** between bag, slot, drop and back (`bagPut`, `slotPut`, `spawnDrop`'s `it`) and
  never rebuilt from `s.type` — rebuilding it silently empties somebody's build. What the button
  fires goes through `fireTool` → `emitBit` for every player alike: [tools and
  bits](docs/dev/gameplay.md#tools-and-bits).
- **Anything deciding it can see a player asks `seenAt(p, range)`**, never a bare range — that one
  function is where GHOSTSTEP and burial live (both maps gate on `concealOf(p)`).
- **Anything painting a team's colour indexes by `skin(team)`** — `TEAMS[skin(p.team)]`,
  `SPRITES.champ[c][skin(t)]`, every per-team sprite set — never by the bare index: your side is
  always BLUE on your screen (`settings.teamBlue`), and a bare `TEAMS[p.team]` is the one thing
  on it painted the wrong colour. Rules (`p.team`, `enemyOf`) never call it.
- **What a key does lives in `keyPress`/`keyRelease`, what a button does in `pointerPress`/
  `pointerRelease`** (input.js), never in a listener: a gamepad and a finger press the same keys
  and buttons through those four, so a key handled in the listener alone is dead on a pad.
- **Anything a player does takes a `p` and reads `p.input`**, never `keys`/`mouse` (local player only),
  and anything only one of them can get (a work swing, a build, a drop, a fish) goes through
  `contest()`, which picks the winner from (SEED, player id, `state.tick`).
- **Never add or remove an `rng()` call inside `genWorld()`** — it reshuffles every existing seed
  (hence landmarks' own `lmRng`). Use `hash2`/`vnoise` per tile, never before the `SEED` const.
- **At most one object per tile.** Create with `placeObj`, read with `objAt`, and route structures
  through `placeStruct`/`destroyStructure` so the `structures` registry stays in sync. A building with
  `w`/`h` in `STRUCTS` (the bot bay, 3×2) fills its other tiles with `part` objects pointing at the
  anchor — **read one off a tile with `structOf(objAt(...))`**, create/remove only via
  `createStruct`/`removeStruct`. **What a type *is* lives in its `OBJECTS`/`STRUCTS` entry, never
  in an `if`** — generic code asks the table: [checklists](docs/dev/checklists.md#common-changes).

## Keeping the docs current

**The docs are part of the deliverable.** When a change makes a line in this file or in
`docs/dev/*.md` false, fix it in the same turn as the code change — a stale line is worse than a
missing one, because future sessions act on it without re-verifying. Prune
[Known drift](docs/dev/checklists.md#known-drift) once fixed; what is worth recording at all:
[checklists](docs/dev/checklists.md#what-is-worth-recording).

**Keep this file under ~150 lines** — it loads in full at the start of every session, and rule
adherence drops as it grows. Anything derivable by reading the code belongs in `docs/dev/*.md`,
which costs nothing until opened. Move a section out rather than thinning every section into mush.
