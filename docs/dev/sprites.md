# Working on sprites

How the ASCII-grid sprite system works and which sprites share grids with which. Read this before
editing [../../js/sprites.js](../../js/sprites.js) — note the encoding warning at the end.

Sprites are literal ASCII grids paired with a palette object mapping character → hex (or `null`
for transparent), baked by `bake()` at load. Left-facing variants are `flipH()` of the right ones.
Character sprites are 16×16; the raider set (`SPRITES.raider`, `RDPAL`) is baked from the exact
same grids as the player, so a player pose edit changes both. The tiered structures use the same
trick: one grid each (`wall`, `turret`, `generator`, all 16×16) baked with `WPAL` /
`WPAL_STONE` / `WPAL_GOLD` — a grid edit changes all three
tiers, and the palettes share the extra `k`/`K` (iron fitting) and `e` (glow) chars, which is also
what a building's team paint rides on (see below). A sprite too tall for a 16×16 wheel wedge gets
a dedicated icon grid baked into `teamBuild[team].icon` (the turret's and the bay's). The
**bot bay** (`spawner`) is the one big sprite: a single-tier 48×38 grid (`bay`, `BAYPAL`) on a 3×2
tile footprint — steel plates under a flat two-row snow cap, a team-painted lintel band (`L`/`T`/`t`
via `bayTeamPal`), riveted flanks with a grille and hazard stripe, and a 20-px dark doorway (cols
14–33, rows 13–35, floor row 36 — `drawBayOverlay` in draw-world.js clips to it). Its 16×16 wheel glyph is
a separate grid, `bayIcon`, exported as `teamBuild[team].icon.spawner`; the old 16×16 `spawner` grid
is still baked as the flat `SPRITES.spawner` but unreferenced. The
construction stages are one shared `scaffold` set (`[posts, frame, lattice-overlay]`, `SCPAL`),
and the worker bot is one 12×10 grid on `BOTPAL` (`botA`/`botB`: a faceless boxy chassis with
stub arms sitting on a single full-width tread, the two frames differing only in the tread
notches). The body chars `L`/`T`/`t` are the team paint (`teamRobotPal` → `coatL`/`coat`/`coatD`),
so `robotTeam[team]` is the whole bot in that colour; `drawRobot()` bobs the entire sprite while
driving and adds the tool swing and the carried nugget in code.

**Prone is a fifth pose direction**, a `prone` key sitting beside `down`/`up`/`right`/`left` in
each champion's set (`champ[c][team].prone[dir][frame]`, three frames a direction: settled and two
of the crawl). The body lies **across** the 16×16 cell rather than standing up through it, so a
player's ground contact stays where the standing feet were and the y-sort never jumps when they
drop — foreshortened, not shrunk: twelve rows head-on to the standing sixteen, eight deep and
fifteen long side-on. Everything about the read is segmentation (boots, split calves, thighs
widening into the coat hem, elbows out past the shoulders to the full width of the cell, a small
head at the front), because pants sit a shade off the outline colour and an unsegmented lower body
just reads as a dark brick. The crawl frames alternate the reaching arm **and** the drawn-up knee,
since a belly crawl hauls with one arm and pushes off the opposite leg; the 1 px inch forward
between them is applied by `drawPlayer`, not baked into a second set of grids. The skater's set
swaps the pom hat for her hood, the eye for the goggle band, adds the trailing scarf and shows the
blade as a plate under each boot.

These are the one place `bakeSpan()` is used instead of `bake()`: it attaches `spans`, the per-row
`[firstX, lastX]` of painted pixels computed straight off the char grid, and `flipH` mirrors that
array with the canvas. The game's snow cover reads it to size the mound to the pose
([rendering.md](rendering.md#snow-over-a-body)) — which means editing a prone grid updates the
cover for free, and there is no canvas readback anywhere in the feature.
**The fish catch is three more DOWN frames** in every class set - `catch: [stoop, haul, hoist]` beside
the four directions and `prone`, baked by `catchSet` from `catchStoop`/`catchHaul`/`catchHold` (the
skater's `skCatch*` on her body plan) through the class palette plus `CATCHPAL_EXTRA`, the fish's own
letters (outline, two blues, belly, eye, a flying drop) so the catch keeps its colour under either
team's paint. The hoist is **16x20**: four rows of fish above the hat on the same feet, which is why
`drawPlayer` draws every frame at `ay + (16 - spr.height)` and lifts the overhead stack 4 px while it
is up. Look A off `docs/media/concepts/fish-catch-concepts-1.png`; which frame shows and for how long
is `catchFrame` / `CATCH_T` in [js/tools.js](../../js/tools.js) - [fishing](world.md#ice-holes-and-fishing).

**Team colours are palette swaps of those same grids.** `TEAM_SKINS` (two presets, RED and BLUE,
also exported as `SPRITES.teams` so the game code can read the names and marker colours) drives
four baked sets — the three below plus `eagleTeam[team]`: the drop eagle's three flap frames with
the torso band (the rows the head sits in, which hold still across the frames) re-lettered by
`armorize()` to plate/helm chars and baked in team colour, so the armour recolours only pixels
the bird already has and the silhouette is untouched (`eagleFlash` is the same trick in all
white, for the downed objective's hit flash):
`playerTeam[team]` (coat/hat/trim swapped — `SPRITES.player` *is* `playerTeam[0]`),
`teamBuild[team][type][tier]` (the tier material with the `k`/`K`/`e` accents repainted, so tier
still reads as tier), `robotTeam[team]`, and `merchant[team]` — the eagle's driver
([the merchant](gameplay.md#the-merchant)): its **own grids**, `merchDown`/`merchUp`/`merchSide`
plus `merchFeet` — **16 × 18**, two rows taller than a player — an old trader in a wide flat
**fur hat** (`f`/`F`, twelve wide, the silhouette) with a **team-cloth crown** (`y`/`Y`, the one
team ink and all of it), a white **beard** (`w`/`W`) down the chest, a khaki wool coat
(`r`/`R`/`d`) hanging straight to the hem, boots under it, three frames a direction (the boots
walk, the coat hangs; the side grid faces right and flips), under `merchantPal`. It is look **D**
off the concept sheet in `docs/media/concepts/merchant-concepts-2.png` (the `concept-art` skill
in `.claude/skills/` is how a sheet is made and picked — two rounds of hoods and hats came
before this one). Nothing on it is a player's coat or hat, so the side reads off the crown, the
nameplate and the bar (no prone poses — it never lies down). A new character or building sprite has to
be added to those bakes, not just to the flat `SPRITES` entry, or it will not wear a team's
colour — and every read of one of them indexes by `skin(team)` (js/player.js), never the bare
team, so your side is painted blue whichever index it was dealt. The swing
tool icons (`itemBow`/`itemAxe`/`itemPick`) are 8×8 grids sharing `AXPAL`, drawn at **1×** by
`drawHeldTool()` (inside a translate/rotate, resolved through `SPRITES[t.icon]` from the
`SWING_TOOLS` table) and by `drawRobot()` for a bot's swing — E picks the tool, there is no tool
bar. At rest `drawHeldTool()` draws the **weapon on the selected slot** instead, which is a 12×12
`toolArt_*` canvas baked in [js/tools.js](../../js/tools.js) rather than here; both sizes go
through the same code because the icon is centred on its own half-width. The **gear icons** are
twelve 12×12 grids, **one per variant** (`gearLongsight` … `gearGhoststep`), each baked once per
**material** — `GEAR_MAT_PALS`, leather → iron → steel → gold, plus the shared accent chars `w`
(ice-white) and `r` (hearth-red) — into `SPRITES.gearIcons[slot][variant][material]`: the glyph
says which piece, the material says its level. Drawn by the HUD's gear plates and class select's
collapsed gear widget; the gear pop-up's wells wear the detailed 32×32 `GEAR32` set instead
(js/menu.js — see [gameplay.md](gameplay.md#gear)). `itemBag` is
12×12 for the same reason — it sits in the same 18 px HUD well — but shares `ITPAL` with the
8×8 item icons rather than taking a material palette: it is one object, not four levels of one.
The five **roguelike card** icons take the gear icons' trick the other way round: one shared 8×8
`itemCard` silhouette (a card face with a sparkle pip), baked five times through `CARD_PALS` —
White/Green/Blue/Purple/Gold — where the rarity itself is the only colour that changes (`C`), so
`itemCardWhite`…`itemCardGold` are five palette swaps of one grid, the same relationship `GEAR_MATS`
has to a single gear icon.

**The pine is twenty-four bend frames of one tree**, and one of two sprites here not drawn by hand
(the gold sack below is the other):
`treeSway` is `docs/media/new_media/001.png` cropped to **27×37**, snapped onto
`TSPAL` (fourteen colours, `bake`d like everything else), and then **sheared** into its other
frames. It draws at
`(px - 5, py - 21)` with its trunk on the tile's centre line, and **through `SPRITES.treeAtlas`,
never through `SPRITES.tree`** — because a `drawImage` that
changes source texture cannot be batched and a wide view holds a thousand pines
([rendering.md](rendering.md#drawing-a-thousand-of-something)).

The array is a **ladder, not a cycle**: index 0 is the tree thrown fully left, 23 fully right, 11
and 12 are it standing up. A frame here is a *lean*, so `treeFrame` maps the wind's signed sway
onto an index directly and a gust lays every tree inside it over the same way — where the sixteen
variant crops this replaced could only morph one tree's branches into another's, which no ordering
makes into a forest bending. The shear is a **tip-loaded cantilever** rounded per row: a row `h` of
the way up from the base moves `2.6 * (3h² - h³) / 2` px, which is zero slope where the trunk meets
the snow, all of the curve in the crown, and 6 px of travel at the tip end to end. Rows cross their
rounding thresholds at different heights, so 21 of the 24 frames are distinct pixels.

Every frame being the same tree, the atlas holds **forty-eight**: the 24 again, mirrored, with the
tile's `hash2` sending half the forest into them — which, together with the small standing lean that
hash also gives, is what keeps a stand from reading as one stamp repeated. `TPAL` above it stays: it
still dresses the `stump` a felled pine leaves. Which frame a tree is wearing is decided by the
wind, not here - [rendering.md](rendering.md#the-wind-field).

**The gold sack is the merchant's mark, and the second imported sprite.** `SPRITES.goldSack` is
`docs/media/new_media/bag_of_gold_spritesheet.png` — a 192×32 strip — split at 32 px into the six
frames `sackA`…`sackF` and snapped onto `SACKPAL` (fourteen colours: three outlines, four cloth,
five coin, two shine), pixel for pixel, so the file and the grids are the same picture. Unlike the
pine the **source order IS the animation order**: it was drawn as a loop, and the cloth barely
moves while the coin in the neck of the sack sparkles, so the cycle reads as light catching gold
rather than as a bag being jostled.

It is authored at 32 and **baked at 16**, through `bakeHalf` — the one thing in this file that does
not bake a grid at its own cell size. Its only caller is the market plate
([the plates](rendering.md#market-notices-the-plates-under-the-minimap)), which is HUD chrome where
16 is the size that reads. `bakeHalf` averages each 2×2 block with the alpha as the weight rather
than blitting the canvas down, because a plain half-size blit throws away three pixels in four and
on art whose whole animation is a 1 px sparkle moving about that *is* the animation thrown away.
Edit the grids at 32; what ships is the average of them.

**The crate is the other mark on that plate, and it is hand-drawn.** `SPRITES.crate` is the 16×16
`crate` grid on `CRATE_PAL` (five colours: an outline, plank in shade and in light, the pale X of
bracing, and the top rail's highlight), `bake`d 1:1 at the size it is drawn — a still box has no
sparkle to lose, so there is nothing for a 32 px authoring pass to preserve. It replaces the sack
on the plate whose news is a **turnover** rather than a price (`NOTE_KIND.stock.mark`,
[the plates](rendering.md#market-notices-the-plates-under-the-minimap)): same 16×16 stamp, same
sunken well, so the column reads as one column whichever kind lands in it.

**The turret is half grid, half raster.** `turret` is a **32×32** mount — collar, column, plinth
and snow skirt — whose top 16 rows are deliberately empty. The rotating housing and barrel are not
baked at all: `drawTurretHead()` in draw-world.js rasterises them pixel by pixel at the live bearing and
dilates the result into a 1px dark rim, exactly as the arrows do, because a baked grid would lock
the gun to one angle. The pivot is sprite-local **(16, 14)**, just above the collar. Two knock-ons:
the sprite is wider than its one-tile footprint, so the draw pass centres it (`sx` in the structure
branch of `render()`); and a 32px sprite is too big for a radial-wheel segment, so `turretIcon` (the
old 16×16 cannon) is baked into `teamBuild[team].icon.turret`, the same escape hatch the bay uses.
Wildlife is
side-view only — rabbits are 12×11 (sit) / 14×9 (hop), deer are 26×22 (stand + two walk frames
sharing a `deerHead` upper body), wolves are 16×13 (a shared `wolfBody` plus three leg rows per
frame, the deer's trick), birds are 9×6 (perched) / 9×5 (two wing frames) — and left variants are
`flipH` of the right-facing grids. The camps' two [alpha and dire wolf](world.md#camps) are
**placeholder looks derived from the wolf, not grids**: `wash` washes the wolf's frames toward
silver (alpha) or a dark red (dire) and `double` blows the dire up to 32�26 nearest-neighbour
(the tail of js/sprites.js) — each wants its own grid through the concept-art skill one day.
The two camp props are
`deadTree` (two 16×24 snags on `DTPAL`, the footprint the pine used to share so they draw in the same
band) and `den` (one 16×12 mound on `DNPAL`, drawn at `py + 4` like a rock). The berry bush is
four frames on `BPAL` — `bush`, `bushEmpty`, `bushBud`, `bushRipen` — one silhouette in which only
the four berry pixels change (ripe, gone, pale `b` buds, dull `d` berries), because the frames are
a clock the player reads at a glance and a bush that seemed to move would read as a different
plant ([the regrow stages](world.md#the-tile-world)).
Anything drawn through `drawSpriteFlash` must stay within 64×64.

**New sprites bake beside the code that draws them, not here.** The treasure chest (`CHEST_SPR`,
js/draw-world.js) and every tool and bit icon (`TOOL_ART` / `BIT_ART` / `bakeGrid`, js/tools.js)
paint their char grids onto their own canvases and assign into `SPRITES`, which works because it
is a plain object. The reason is the paragraph below: `js/sprites.js` is byte-fragile, so the
fewer sessions that rewrite it, the better. Tool art goes further and follows the gear icons'
trick — one 12×12 silhouette per family, baked once per **tier** through `TOOL_ART_PAL`, so shape
says which weapon and palette says how good it is. The two detailed 32×32 icon sets do the same:
the ability icons (`AB32`/`AB32_PAL`, js/abilities.js) and the gear-variant icons (`GEAR32`,
js/menu.js) bake lazily beside their drawers, and `GEAR32` deliberately shares `AB32_PAL` so
every big icon in the game speaks one palette.

`js/sprites.js` has a UTF-8 BOM and **seven** rows that repair a mangled byte via
`'...'.replace('о', 'g')` — in `stump`, `imp1` (×2), `wall` (×2, one of them a `/g` replace),
`heartHalf` and `heartEmpty`. Preserve the file's encoding when editing — re-saving it as
something else will corrupt the grids, and the corruption is silent: `bake()` sizes each canvas
from `rows[0].length` alone, so an unmatched palette char is indistinguishable from a transparent
pixel and a broken repair just shifts that grid row one column sideways. (`heartHalf`'s repair is
currently a no-op — `.replace('g', 'g')`.)
