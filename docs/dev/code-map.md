# Where things live in the game code

The game code is ~14000 lines of flat top-level code across twenty-two files sharing one global
scope ([architecture.md](architecture.md) has the file table and the load order), organized
inside each file only by banner comments of the form `// ------ name`. **Keep every banner
honest** — one that has drifted from what sits under it is worse than no banner, because it sends
future sessions to the wrong 600 lines. If a section grows past ~250 lines or picks up a second
responsibility, split it and add the new banner to its file's table below.

Grep the banner (`// ------ actions`) to jump; the function names are the durable anchors —
don't cite line numbers here, they go stale within a session. Sections follow index.html's load
order; the legacy `audio.js` row rides along because its dials get asked after constantly.
