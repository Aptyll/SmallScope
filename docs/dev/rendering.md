# Rendering

Everything that draws: the camera, the pass order, the baked panels, and the pixel cursor.
Read this before touching `render()`, adding a draw pass, or changing anything positioned off
`VIEW_W`/`VIEW_H`. The hard invariants are summarised in [../../CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md).

## One-camera fullscreen pixel rendering

Every player gets the **same camera** (the SC2/League model): the view always shows
`TARGET_ROWS` (360) rows of world — a 1920×1080 fullscreen is exactly 640×360 at 3×, 1440p is
the same frame at 4× and 4K at 6×, and other monitors buy sharpness with their extra pixels,
never zoom. There is deliberately **no resolution setting**; camera zoom is a gameplay feature
(below), not a display one. (The frame was 480×270 until 3.22; the menus, panels and end screens
are still authored in that 270-row frame and centred in the taller view through `frameTop()`,
core.js — `FRAME_H` names it.) `VIEW_W`/`VIEW_H` are `let`s set by `fitCanvas()`:

- It picks an integer **device**-pixel scale (via `devicePixelRatio`, so game pixels land
  exactly on device pixels even under fractional 125%/150% OS scaling) closest to
  `deviceH / TARGET_ROWS`. It does not depend on the zoom — the canvas is laid out the same at
  every zoom (see [World zoom](#world-zoom-and-the-two-pixel-spaces)), which is what keeps the
  HUD a fixed size on screen. `scale` is fractional in CSS px and must not be floored.
- **The backing store is in device pixels**: `canvas.width = VIEW_W * devScale`. The UI still
  draws in `VIEW_W`×`VIEW_H` space — `render()` puts a `devScale` transform under it, so 1px
  rects and the 3×5 font blow up by a whole number and stay exact — and no layout code changes.
  The extra resolution exists for one reason: it is what lets a world pixel be a whole number of
  *device* pixels at zooms that are not whole numbers of *canvas* pixels.
- Heights that don't divide cleanly (1440p → 5×, 288 rows) **"breathe"** a few percent rather
  than letterbox or blur — the Terraria/Stardew trade. 16:9 screens always fill edge-to-edge.
- `VIEW_W` is **capped at 16:9** (`ceil(VIEW_H * 16/9)`): wider-than-16:9 monitors get pillarbox
  bars instead of extra vision — the SC2 rule. Narrower screens simply see less width. A guard
  keeps the view at least 320×240 so the UI panels always fit. **A phone takes neither the
  target rows nor the cap** — see [Phones](#phones).
- A third canvas, `#replay`, sits *above* `#game` and carries the replay window at device
  resolution; see [Replay](#replay-the-last-four-seconds). It is the only thing drawn outside
  `#game`'s pixel grid, and the only reason is that the grid has too few pixels there.
- The bars are **themed, not black**: a second full-window canvas (`#bars`, z-order under
  `#game`, `pointer-events: none`) carries a static frost-panel frame — night slab, mottling,
  ice crystals, icicle fringes on the top and bottom edges, and an icy bevel hugging the game
  view — baked by
  `renderBars()` in the game palette. It spans `FULL_W` (the pre-cap window width in game px)
  and is deliberately darker than the world so the eye stays on the game; on ≤16:9 screens it
  is cleared and fully covered. It uses `hash2`, so it must never run before boot — it is baked
  once per canvas size by `relayout()`, never per frame, and the game never draws into it.

## Phones

`MOBILE` (js/mobile.js) is the one flag: `mobileRefresh()` sets it from the TOUCH MODE setting
(`settings.mobile`: `'auto'` reads the device — a coarse primary pointer, touch events and a
screen whose short side is under `MOBILE_SHORT` CSS px, so a tablet stays on the desktop fit —
`'on'`/`'off'` force it), and `fitCanvas()` calls it first, so a flip anywhere (the setting,
boot reading the saved one, a resize onto another screen) re-fits the view. What a phone gets:

- **The biggest game pixel the overlays allow.** The world map slab is 212×226 at the floor (it grows with the view: `fitMapSlab`, canvas.js) and the settings
  slab 320×226, so a phone takes the largest whole device-pixel scale that keeps the view above
  `MOBILE_MIN_W`×`MOBILE_MIN_H` (320×232) — far fewer rows than a monitor's 360 (a 1170-px-tall
  phone lands on 234 rows at 5×; a 1080-px one cannot, 5× would be 216, so it takes 270 rows
  at 4×), and the 3×5 font and the HUD grow with the pixel.
  It is the same rule as the desktop's 320×240 guard with the target rows removed; the `TARGET_ROWS`
  nearest-scale pick is the desktop branch only.
- **No 16:9 cap and no frost bars**: `VIEW_W = FULL_W`. A phone is 19.5:9 or wider and the
  width is the thumbs' room, so `renderBars()` clears itself (its bars are under 2 px).
- **The camera opens at `MOBILE_ZOOM`** (1.5): the moment phone mode comes on, `fitCanvas` sets
  `zoomCur` to it before re-runging `kWant`, so a sprite is thumb-sized. The wheel's rungs are
  unchanged; the touch zoom pair steps the same `kWant`.
- **Its own HUD SIZE**: `settings.hudScaleM` (default 1.25) — `hudSc()` reads
  `hudScaleKey()`'s field, and the one GAME slider edits whichever is live, so a profile that
  plays on both keeps both.
- **The touch controls** draw above everything but the fade and the cursor
  (`drawTouchControls`, the `touch controls` banner, js/ui/touch-plates.js): plates from `touchLayout()`
  (js/touch.js), a floating stick under each thumb that is down (white for the walk, the
  draw's gold for the aim). Over a panel only the one menu plate stays, as a cross, and it
  presses Escape. The plates' glyphs are the CONTROLS page's TOUCH tab's (`drawTouchIcon`).
- **The weapon shelf sits under the plates**: the top-left is the menu cog and the zoom pair's
  corner too, so `shelfRowY()` drops the row to 44 on a phone (20 on a desktop) and the
  [drawer](#the-backpack) under it drops with it. The right-hand touch column climbs from the
  bottom edge like the left one.
- **The pixel cursor on a finger is the reticle only** (`render()`'s last line): the aim a
  finger or a pad is steering is worth drawing, an arrow under a thumb is not. `mouse.src`
  says who moved the pointer last (input.js).
- **Held upright**, `mobilePortrait()` is true: `drawRotatePrompt` covers the frame with a
  night slab and a phone snapping between upright and sideways under an arrow, and
  `touchDown` swallows every finger. `mobileGesture()` asks for fullscreen and a landscape
  lock on every press until one lands (a phone Safari grants neither; the refusals are silent).

`DBG.setMobile('on')` forces the phone fit on any window;
[checklists](checklists.md#verifying-a-change) has the emulation recipe.

## World zoom, and the two pixel spaces

**Zoom scales the world and nothing else.** The canvas keeps its `TARGET_ROWS` size at every
zoom level, so the HUD, the baked panels, the minimap and the cursor are pixel-identical
however close the camera is — scrolling in moves the camera, it does not magnify the interface.

That falls out of rendering in **two pixel spaces**:

| Space | Size | Written through | Holds |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| world | `WV_W`×`WV_H` | `ctx` while it points at `wctx` | ground → … → `renderLighting` |
| screen | `VIEW_W`×`VIEW_H` (backed by `VIEW * devScale` device px) | `ctx` while it points at `uictx`, under a `devScale` transform | weather, vignettes, all UI |

`ctx` is therefore **not a fixed binding**: `render()` sets `ctx = wctx` before the ground blit
and `ctx = uictx` straight after `renderLighting`. Between them it drops to the identity
transform and blits `worldCv` **in device pixels** at `k = zoomCur * devScale` px per world px,
then sets the `devScale` transform for everything below. Doing the scale-up as **one
nearest-neighbour resample of an already-composed frame** is what keeps it coherent: ground,
sprites, particles and floaters are drawn together at 1:1 first, so they share one pixel grid
instead of each rounding its own edges and shimmering against its neighbours.

Consequences a new pass has to respect:

- **A world pass bounds itself against `WV_W`/`WV_H`, never `VIEW_W`/`VIEW_H`.** Below zoom 1
  the world view is *wider* than the canvas, and culling to the canvas eats the edges.
- `worldCv` is allocated at the most zoomed-out size (`ZOOM_FLOOR`) once per
  canvas size, and each frame uses the `WV_W`×`WV_H` corner — never resize it per frame.
- Anything **UI-layer but anchored to a world point** (only the radial wheel today) converts
  through `wToSX`/`wToSY`, and keeps its own pixel size.
- **A pointer position becomes a world position only through `mouseWX()`/`mouseWY()`**
  (`mouse / zoomCur + cam`). Aim, hover, the work target and the right-click tile all read them,
  so the zoom cannot be applied in one place and forgotten in another.
- The camera centres and clamps on `WV_W`/`WV_H`; the aim lean divides by `zoomCur` so it stays
  the same *fraction* of the view at every zoom.
- Weather and the vignettes sit **above** the blit deliberately: a flake keeps its own crisp
  size at every zoom, and its drift multiplies by `zoomCur` so the field still scrolls with the
  ground under it.

### The resting zoom is always pixel-exact

A world pixel ends up covering **`zoom × devScale` device pixels**. Unless that is a whole
number, some world pixels get an extra row of device pixels and their neighbours do not — which
on a 16×16 sprite is exactly what "stretched" looks like. So the zoom the player rests at is
not stored as a float at all:

- **`kWant` is that whole number** — device px per world px — and the wheel steps it by **±1**,
  clamped to `kMin()`…`kMax()` (`ZOOM_MIN` … `ZOOM_MAX` × `devScale`). `zoomWantOf()`
  derives the float scale as `kWant / devScale`.
- **The range is authored in rows of world on screen**, not in scale: `ZOOM_OUT_ROWS` (540, the
  whole clearing) and `ZOOM_IN_ROWS` (75, a face), and `ZOOM_MIN`/`ZOOM_MAX` are
  `TARGET_ROWS` over each (0.67 … 4.8 at 360 rows), so a taller frame neither hands out more
  vision at max-out nor loses the face at max-in. `DROP_ZOOM` is `ZOOM_MIN`.
- The rungs are therefore `k / devScale`. At `devScale` 3 (a 1080p fullscreen) that is **third
  steps** — 0.67, 1, 1.33, 1.67 … 4.67, thirteen of them; at 4 (1440p) it is quarters, seventeen.
  A display with fewer pixels to spend gets fewer, coarser rungs, which is the honest answer
  rather than a lie.
- `sizeWorldView()` **ceils** (never rounds): `WV × k` must *cover* the canvas or a sliver of
  stale pixels survives down the right edge.
- `fitCanvas()` re-rungs `kWant` onto the new ladder (`round(zoomCur * dev)`) whenever `devScale`
  changes — a resize, a fullscreen toggle, a drag to another monitor.

**In motion it is deliberately not exact.** `applyZoom(dt)`, first thing in `update()`, eases
`zoomCur` toward `kWant / devScale` exponentially at `ZOOM_EASE` 16/s (~0.13 s to 90%,
frame-rate independent) and parks it exactly on the rung. **It zooms about the centre of the
view**: `camX`/`camY` name the top-left corner, so after `sizeWorldView()` it shifts them by
half the change in `WV_W`/`WV_H`, and the world point under the middle of the screen stays put
through every frame of the ease. Without that the picture pivots about the corner and the follow
camera (7/s, against the ease's 16/s) drags it back over most of a second — measured 55 screen
px off centre four frames into a two-notch zoom in. While the ease runs the blit scale is
fractional and ~12% of pixels break the grid; nobody reads pixel edges mid-zoom, and it lands
clean. Measured with a block-uniformity scan over ~270k device px per rung: **0 stray pixels at
every rung, on both a `devScale` 3 and a `devScale` 4 display; 12.3% mid-glide.**

Nothing in that path touches the canvas, so unlike the old `applyView()` it never calls
`fitCanvas()`/`relayout()` **and the overlays no longer force the zoom back to base** — the
fixed-size panels fit at any zoom now. `applyZoom(0, true)` snaps instead of easing, which is
what `beginDrop`/`landPlayer` use. The eagle ride forces `DROP_ZOOM` (the max-out view, `ZOOM_OUT_ROWS`
of world) for as long as mode is `drop`; landing returns to whatever the player had set.
`DBG.setK(k, snap)` sets the rung directly, `DBG.setZoom(z, snap)` lands on the nearest rung,
and `DBG.getZoom()` reports `k`, `devScale`, `exact` and the whole `rungs` ladder. The scroll
wheel is zoom only — there is no tool selection to cycle.

Zooming **out** past the baseline is now allowed, which retires the old fairness ceiling
(nobody buys vision) — a PvP rule from when widening the view meant enlarging the canvas.

**Mouse coords are divided by `scale` on the way in**, landing in screen space. Round positions
when drawing (`Math.round`) or sprites smear across subpixels.

**Cross-file invariant:** any code path that changes the canvas size — window resize,
`fullscreenchange` — must call `fitCanvas()` then `relayout()`. `relayout()` recomputes
everything positioned off `VIEW_W`/`VIEW_H`: the minimap anchors, the map/settings panel
positions (`PANEL_X/Y`, `SET_X/Y`, `SL_X`, `ROW_*` — `let`s **declared in the `canvas` banner
beside `relayout()`**, not down in their own sections, so `relayout()` never reaches forward
into a temporal dead zone; the offsets *within* each baked panel stay fixed in their own
sections), `fitFlakes()`, which keeps snow density constant by topping up/trimming
the `flakes` array (see [Snow](#snow)), and `renderBars()`, which re-bakes the pillarbox frame. Never write layout
code against a literal 640/360 (or the old 480/270); a screen authored in the 270-row frame
starts at `frameTop()` (`FRAME_H`, core.js) — `menuLayout()` shows the pattern (`toy` offset).

`render()` keeps two camera offsets: tiles and other statics subtract the rounded `ox`/`oy`,
while moving entities (player, animals, robots, drops, particles, floaters, swing arc) subtract
the exact `ex`/`ey` and round once at the end. Screen pos must be `round(world - camera)` with a
**single** rounding — rounding camera and entity separately makes their boundary crossings
disagree and the sprite vibrates ±1px against the background while walking (measured 48 flips/s),
which reads as ghosting on high-refresh displays. New entity draw code must use `ex`/`ey`.

## Render pass order

`render()` runs: ground blit → under-ice fish → ice-crack decals → the parkour start line
(`drawParkourLine`, `PRACTICE` only) → **the stars reflected in the ice**
(`drawIceStars`, night only — on the surface, so it covers the fish and the cracks, and under
everything that walks) → footprints (walking prints,
slide grooves, skate scratches and belly-crawl furrows all share the one `footprints` array,
branching on `f.k`) → flat objects
(stumps, and **fish nets** via `drawNet`) → item drops → **y-sorted
`draws` array** (tall objects + every live player + animals + robots, sorted by feet Y; empty
players draw as team-tinted silhouettes via `drawGhost`) →
selection brackets (`drawSelection`: white pulsing corners with a dark shadow over the hovered
stump / open ice hole / finished structure, or the wheel's target) → the E work prompt (`drawWorkHint`) → the
fish brackets (`drawFishHint`) → the parkour's lap clock and BEST/LAST plate
(`drawParkour`, `PRACTICE` only) → construction progress bars → particles →
arrows (bolts branch to `drawBolt`) → `drawWarps` (the silhouettes a teleport strung across its
jump) → **`drawSwaps`** ([the tool swap](#the-tool-swap)) → `drawTurretFx` (each turret's charging aim line and its
muzzle flash) → turret tracers → swing arcs (one per swinging player) → floaters → `drawDropAir` (the
eagle, its shadow, the rider and every faller, while `state.drop` exists) → `renderLighting` →
`drawNavPaths` + `drawHitboxes` (the `.` debug overlay — deliberately **above** the lighting,
see [Debug overlays](#debug-overlays-hitboxes-and-routes)) →
**the world blit** (`worldCv` scaled onto the canvas — everything above it drew in world space,
everything below draws in screen space; see [World zoom](#world-zoom-and-the-two-pixel-spaces))
→ `renderWeather` (snow, see below) →
`renderVignettes` → **`replayTick`** (banks the frame just finished into the replay ring — it
sits here, not at the end of `render()`, so the strip holds no HUD, no dim and no picture of
itself) → `renderUI` (skipped in `title` and `drop`) → `renderDropUI` (mode `drop` only:
the flight bar, keybind indicators) → `drawDropBrief` (mode `play`,
only while [the drop brief](#the-drop-brief) holds a roost) or `drawHopPrompt` (mode `play`, the
local player still seated on its roost: the HOP OFF key cap — E, or the pad's A disc while one is in hand) → `renderWheel` (radial menu, above the UI) →
map/settings overlays (the M map also in mode `drop`) → `renderTitle` (the main menu, also during the play intro) → the end-of-match
overlay (`renderDead`: the death dim and its planks, or `renderVictory` / `renderDefeat` — see
[The end screens](#the-end-screens)) →
`renderReplay` (the replay window, above both the death dim and the pause dim) →
the held-TAB scoreboard (deliberately **above** the death dim, see
[Scoreboard and event log](#scoreboard-and-event-log)) →
the info stack (`drawTags`, left edge at the top quarter: FPS / POS / SEED as aligned
label-value rows — one ESC-menu toggle or F3; only the fps line in `title`) → the screen fade
(`state.fade`, the reroll whiteout) → the pixel cursor (always last). The bow's
`drawAimLine` sits between the particles and the arrows pass. Anything that should be occluded by trees goes into `draws`
with a sort key; anything flat goes in the pre-pass.

A **tree** is 27×37 and draws at `(px - 5, py - 21)` — bottom-aligned on its own tile, trunk on
the tile's centre line, canopy overhanging the tile above (which the `draws`
loop's existing 1-tile top margin and 2-tile bottom margin already cover). How far over it is
leaning comes from `treeFrame(tx, ty)` off the [wind field](#the-wind-field), never
from a clock of its own, and it is blitted out of **one atlas texture** rather than a per-frame
canvas — see [Drawing a thousand of something](#drawing-a-thousand-of-something), which is the
largest performance fact in this file. The pines **surrounding the viewed hero** take the
**occluder fade**, a two-layer visibility pocket: alpha is a pure function of trunk-to-hero
distance (`TREE_FADE_A` floor inside `TREE_FADE_R0` — the adjacent ring, hard-faded so the hero
reads clearly through it — climbing back to opaque by `TREE_FADE_R1`, the two-tile ring that
gives the pocket a soft edge; consts above `render()`), so the fade eases with every step without
storing anything per tree. The hero's **work target** — the hovered tree, dead tree, rock,
berried bush or chest — draws under a **pulsing gold rim** (`drawTargetRim`: the buy plates' two
golds, stamped through the scratch canvas like the silhouette below), so the target is its own
visible state everywhere the cursor lands, not a faded pine quietly borrowing the normal look;
a bare bush never rims because `workTarget`'s `ready` gate already refuses it — a *hovered* bare
bush shows its regrow clock instead, the neutral unit bar (`drawHealthBar`, gold) over the plant
filling toward `BUSH_REGROW`, drawn only while the pointer's tile is that bush (`hovO`, resolved
beside `fadeWkO` at any reach, since a look asks nothing of the legs). A hovered **camp anchor**
(a den's mouth, the alpha stone) wears the same bar the same way — over the prop, filling toward the camp's return off its
respawn clock (`o.site.repopT`, `drawCampClock`, [world.md](world.md#runtime)) while the camp is cleared, nothing
while anything in it lives. A hovered tree
also holds full ink against the fade, and a mid-shake chop lifts a faded neighbour back to
opaque. While any pine
is inside the ramp the hero also wears a **black 1px silhouette rim** — `treeFadeSil`, the
nearest pine's position on the same ramp, computed beside the y-sort and stamped by `drawPlayer`
(the current frame tinted black on the scratch canvas, blitted at the eight neighbours, the same
rim grammar as `drawPixelTextOutline`) — so the body pops off the canopy over it and the rim
dissolves as the hero steps into the open; a lying body keeps its stealth read bare. Only that
handful of pines ever flips `globalAlpha`, so the atlas batch below stays whole. A **dead tree** is still the old 16×24 snag at `py - 8`. Short ground sprites (rock, bush,
stump, a den's mouth) all draw at `py + 4` to stay clear of that band — drop one lower and
a tree on the tile below hides it almost completely.

The **fish net** is the one building that is not in `draws` at all. It lies flat on its hole and
gets walked over, so y-sorting it would put it in front of the player standing on it: `drawNet`
runs in the flat pre-pass instead, at `(px, py)` filling its tile exactly, with its own health bar
and its catch (up to `NET_CAP` fish at `NET_FISH_AT`, each on its own bob) drawn into the mesh —
the catch showing through the rope is the only thing that says a net is worth walking to. An
unfinished net fades in with `buildT` rather than wearing a scaffold, because there is nothing out
on the water to stand a frame on. Its construction bar comes from the shared progress-bar pass
like every other building's.

Sprite hit-flash goes through `drawSpriteFlash()`, which recolours via a shared 64×64 `scratch`
canvas with `source-in` — sprites larger than 64×64 will clip (the 48×38 bot bay is the biggest).

An **item drop** wears its icon centred on its own width (a tool's is 12×12, everything else 8×8)
over a flat shadow, and a find — anything with a tier — pulses a plate of that tier's rim behind
it, so something worth walking to is told from a berry at a distance. One exception: a drop inside
its [throw lock](gameplay.md#the-weapon-shelf) draws at half alpha with the glint **off**, and only
for the one player it is locked against (`dropLocked(d, viewPlayer())`) — what you just threw away
lies dim until it is yours again, and everyone else sees it whole.

### The tool swap

`drawSwaps(ex, ey)` is the world half of the tell a
[tool trading itself up](gameplay.md#where-tools-and-bits-come-from) raises, over one entry per
swap in `swaps` (js/tools.js, pushed by `swapFx`, aged by `updateSwaps` in `updateFx`). It is
drawn for **every** player, not only the local one: a rival rearming mid-fight is news to whoever
is shooting at them, and the ring's colour is the whole of the news.

The beat is `SWAP_T` (1.1 s) in two parts. The **ring** — a hollow square in the new tier's `rim`,
opening from 4 to 18 px out of the chest — is the first third and then gone, so the icon is what
is left to read. The **icon** is the new body's own 12×12, on the tier `plate` inside a `rim`
frame it wears in every well it will ever sit in, climbing `SWAP_RISE` (26 px) on an ease-out and
fading only over the last third. `swapFx` also fires two `burst`s in the tier's ink and rim at the
body, `SFX.levelUp` for the local player (`SFX.pickup` for anyone else in earshot), and the
[shelf's row flash](#the-weapon-shelf).

### Snow

Flakes are **world-space**, not a screen overlay, and the zoom reaches them the way it reaches
everything else in the world. Each entry of `flakes` (the block at the top of the `fx updates`
banner) has a world `x/y` and drifts in world px — `spd` down, its own sine sway plus the
[wind field](#the-wind-field)'s drift, so snow blows sideways in a gust and falls almost straight
down once the air stills at night.

The field is **one world view** in size, not one screen, and that is what makes the zoom read:

- **Count follows the world area on screen.** `fitFlakes()` targets `FLAKE_BASE` (70) per
  `FLAKE_AREA` (480×270) of **world** px — 124 on a 640×360 view at zoom 1 — so zooming out —
  looking at more sky — puts more snow in frame, clamped to `FLAKE_MIN`…`FLAKE_MAX` (26…240)
  because physics alone leaves six flakes on screen at the closest rung and a blizzard of specks
  at the widest, and neither reads as snow. The density per world px is what was tuned, so the
  look at any one spot is unchanged by the wider frame.
- **Grain follows the zoom.** `renderWeather` draws each flake `round(f.size × zoomCur)` px
  across, so up close a flake is a fat crumb rather than a pixel. Between the two the amount of
  white in frame stays about constant while its grain changes, which is what "further away"
  looks like.
- **`fitFlakes()` therefore runs every frame from `updateFx`**, not just from `relayout()`: the
  zoom moves the target as surely as a resize does. Both its loops are no-ops when the count
  already matches, which is every frame but the ones a zoom ease is passing through.

`renderWeather(ex, ey)` wraps every flake **modulo `WV_W`/`WV_H` around the exact camera and
scales up after**, so the field always covers the canvas (`sizeWorldView` ceils, so `WV × zoomCur`
is never short of `VIEW`) while a pan still slides every flake the right way; the wrap is
invisible because it only ever happens at the screen edge. Flakes go through the same
[speck atlas](#specks) as the motes and the stars — `FLAKE_CV`, one baked cell per size — because
240 of them as `fillRect`s with their own `globalAlpha` is 240 draw calls.

A flake does not fall screen-top to screen-bottom: it is born with `h` (30–120) world px left to
fall, **lands** when that runs out, rests on the ground fading out for `FLAKE_REST` (0.7 s), and is
then reborn (`makeFlake`) at a fresh spot in the field.

**The seventy boot flakes come off the main `rng` and that count is load-bearing** — that loop runs
before `genWorld()`, so adding or dropping one shifts the rng prefix and every existing seed with
it. Everything else (resize and zoom top-ups, and **rebirths**) draws from `fxRng`. Rebirths used
to come off `rng` too, which quietly made the main stream depend on how many flakes were on screen;
now that the count follows the zoom that would have made a match's rolls depend on the player's
camera, so they were moved. Worldgen is untouched either way — it runs before the first `updateFx`.

Drawn after `renderLighting` (never graded) and before the vignettes and HUD. `DBG.flakes` and
`DBG.cam()` expose the array and the exact camera.

## UI panels are baked once

`buildMapPanel()`, `buildSettingsPanel()` and `buildHelpPanel()` draw the static chrome (parchment,
labels — the map slab's header is live, since the day changes and the plank lifts) into offscreen canvases at boot (the two frost slabs share `bakeFrostSlab()`); per-frame code blits them and draws only the live parts on top.
Their layout variables (`PANEL_*`, `MAP_*`, `SET_*`, `SL_X`, `ROW_*`) are shared between the bake
function and the per-frame code, so both sides move together — but a bake-side change only appears
after the panel is rebuilt. They are declared **up in the `canvas` banner next to `relayout()`**
(which reassigns them on every canvas-size change) rather than in these sections; a new panel row
must be declared there too. The bake draws in panel-relative coordinates (e.g. `ROW_FPS - SET_Y`),
so a recenter never requires a re-bake — keep any new row's bake-side label and per-frame widget
expressed the same way.

The [trading post](gameplay.md#the-panel) bakes its chrome the same way but **lazily and per
team**: `shopChromeCv(ti)` draws the timber frame, its iron corner brackets, the team-striped
awning with its snow crest, scalloped hem and icicles, and the counter edge into one canvas the
size of the slab, clears the middle out of it, and caches it under the team index — so the live
pass blits one image and then owns every well on top of it. Its size is constant (`SHOP_W` ×
`SHOP_H`), which is why it needs no rebuild on a resize; only the panel's *position* moves.

The map panel's bake keeps a fixed 192×192 map slot; the world is bigger than that, so every
tile-space position drawn on the chart (the camera rect, every mark) is multiplied by
`MAP_S = MAP_W / WORLD`, and `mapTileAt` is the inverse. **The chart is a drawn map, not a
photograph of the tiles** (3.32): `buildWorldMapImg()` files every tile under a `CH_*` class
(`objChart(o)` for what stands on it, else the ground array), flattens the class map — a lone
tile of forest or ice is ground again, a snow pinhole with three sides of one mass is that mass
(`CHART_NEED`) — resamples it into the slot by priority (`chartSpan`: each chart pixel takes the
highest class among the tiles it covers, so a one-tile wall never drops out of its run where 232
tiles fold into 192 px), and paints one flat ink per class (`CHART_INK`) — **a winter chart**:
snow-white open ground, deep cold pine for the woods, pale ice, a tan track for the road. The
light comes from the top-left, as it does on the snow: a mass's rim is lit where lower ground lies
above or left of it and inked where it lies below or right (`CHART_LIT`/`CHART_RIM` — the forest,
the ice, and the road's shadow edge). The ice wears a sparse diagonal sheen and the snow a faint grain
(`chartGrain`), and the woods nothing at all — the palette does the work (a lattice of canopy
dots read as studs and a jittered scatter of pine glyphs as clutter; both were tried and pulled in
3.32), so the chart has the grain of a drawn thing without the noise of one. No grid: a single
bush, rock or stump has no class and shows the ground, because at that scale a speck is noise;
the buried chests keep theirs, a gold speck being a thing worth walking to. A side's buildings
and its bird are two depths of one team ink (`chTeam`/`chEagle`, through `skin()`), so a base
reads as a shape in its colour with the bird bright at its heart. The sim keeps stepping under
it and the local player keeps walking
([the M map does not pause](gameplay.md#the-m-map-does-not-pause)), so every live part — the
camera rect, every body's mark, the watched body's heart — moves while the chart is open; the
image itself is re-inked at most every `MM_REBUILD` ticks, like the minimap's, so a wall built
or a tree felled behind the parchment shows up on it within half a second.

**One grammar for both maps** (`drawMapDot`/`drawMapUnit`/`drawMapYou`/`drawMapBird`, the
`what a body looks like on a map` group in js/draw/marks.js): a square in its side's ink is a
body — a player one step bigger than a robot (3 vs 2 px on the chart, 2 vs 1 on the disc), and
every worker, soldier and merchant standing is drawn, none of them hides; the watched body
(`viewPlayer()`: you, or whoever the camera rides) is a player's square gone white inside a ring
of its side's ink, never a colour of its own that would read as a third team; the bird diamond
is an objective, roosted or flying. Each sits on a 1 px rim in the map's own dark. **The slab is
the chart and a header, nothing else**, and it **fits the view**: `fitMapSlab()` (canvas.js, from
`relayout`) gives the chart every row the view has up to `CHART_MAX` (232 — the match world at one
px a tile, so a monitor charts at 1:1) with `MAP_SIDE`/`MAP_HEAD`/`MAP_FOOT` of parchment round it
(a phone at the 232-row floor gets the 192 chart), and `mapAlloc()` (js/ui/panels.js) remakes the chart's
buffers and re-bakes the slab whenever `MAP_W` changes. The slab is the **frost slab** every
panel shares (`bakeFrostSlab` with no title — the parchment of old read as summer against a winter
chart), the chart in a dark frame with an icy line round it. In the header (`MAP_HEAD_Y`/`MAP_HEAD_H`):
the day at 2× in the slabs' title gold on the left, and on the right the `CLOSE` plate —
`drawFrostButton`, a plate in the slab's own grammar (its stone bound in its dark, lifting off its
shadow on hover, the label going gold), hit through `mapCloseRect`/`mapCloseHit` in `pointerPress`
(play and drop alike; the cursor is a hand over it) — with no compass (the chart is north-up, as
the world is), no key (the marks are the minimap's own), no clock (the disc wears it) and no
title. Every mark on the chart sits on the minimap's own dark (`CHART_DARK`), so a mark reads the
same on both maps.
The minimap is a scrolling viewport, not a whole-world view: `renderMinimap()` blits a
`MM_R / s`-tile square of `mmCv` around `viewPlayer()` into the disc, where `s = mmScale()` is
px per tile — an eased `mmCur` chasing `MM_ZOOMS[settings.mmZoom]` (0.25 … 4 over twelve rungs,
index 5 = the 1:1 baseline) on the same `ZOOM_EASE` the camera uses, so both zooms under one
hand feel like one control. A save written before `settings.v` indexes the old six-rung ladder
and is carried across by `MM_MIGRATE` on load. Stepped by the
scroll wheel while `overMinimap()` (pointer inside the disc + ring), which pre-empts the camera
zoom in the wheel handler and is saved with the settings. Every marker drawn over it (robots, players,
camp glyphs, your side's [flags](gameplay.md#team-flags) with their rings) multiplies its tile
offset by `s`. The disc sits on an opaque `#0f1632`
backing (to `MM_R + 5`) inside a **strong 2 px black outline** (to `MM_R + 7`), and it has **no
hover state** — the chrome is baked once per radius and looks the same whatever the pointer does;
there is no halo or second ring outside it (the pale outer rim and the hover brightening went
in 3.23). `overMinimap()` reaches to that outline's outer edge. **No `arc()` anywhere in it**: canvas arcs anti-alias, and at
game resolution that reads as blur, so `mmRing(g, cx, cy, r0, r1, col, a0?, a1?)` paints the
backing, rims and the day/night band one pixel at a time (pixel-centre distance test, optional
clockwise angle span), and the map view is clipped by `mmMask(r)` — a cached pixel disc
composited with `destination-in` on the `mmView` scratch canvas — instead of `clip()`.
**But `mmRing` never runs per frame**: a per-pixel `hypot`/`atan2` loop issuing a `fillRect`
per lit pixel was ~1.6 ms a frame — the largest single cost in the game. The static chrome
(silhouette, both rim variants, the ring's track) is baked per `(MM_R, hover)` in `mmChrome`,
and the day/night arcs plus the dusk tick per `(MM_R, progress step)` in `mmArcBand` — the
cycle quantised to `MM_ARC_STEPS` (512), about a pixel of arc per step, so the band repaints
every couple of real seconds. Only the progress tip, the centre dot and the markers are
per-frame fills. The terrain image is throttled the same way: `updateMinimap()`'s full
`WORLD²` sweep (a `structOf` call per tile) reruns at most every `MM_REBUILD` (30) sim ticks —
at one map pixel per tile, a build or a cut ice hole arriving half a second late is invisible.

## The HUD corners

`renderUI()` owns three corners, the top edge and one strip, and every one of them is positioned off
`VIEW_W`/`VIEW_H` (never a literal), so a resize needs nothing from them. **The top left is
the weapon** (3.23): the one tool in hand and the bits loaded into it, with the inventory drawer
shut under it — the corner a Noita wand or a Terraria held item lives in — while every number
you own (berries, fish, gold, cards) is on the **hud strip's right end**. The bottom right is
empty world.

| Where | What | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| top left | the **weapon shelf**: the tool in hand and its bit cells in firing order, always up — and under its tool cell the small white arrow of the **inventory drawer**, shut until B or the arrow | `drawShelf`, `drawBag` |
| top right | the minimap and its day/night ring — the black outline sits `MM_GAP` (4 px) off the top edge and the right edge alike (`applyMinimapSize`, core.js) — the clock centred under it, and the market's plates under that | `renderMinimap`, `renderNotices` |
| top centre | the **team rail**: every player in the match as a 14px chip on two plates, your side left (you first, your emblem white) and the rival right, each chip only *up* / *waiting* / *out* — and under it, the camp plate, the DAY headline and the spectate control (`headlineY`) | `drawRailScaled` |
| bottom left | the hover tooltip | `drawTooltip` |
| bottom centre | the segmented plum xp bar over the four ability wells, flush to the bottom | `drawHudStrip` |
| bottom centre, right end | the pouch block: berry over fish, gold over cards, a 2×2 of 24px squares on a tab standing above the strip — the four numbers you own, always on | `drawFoodCell`, `drawGoldCell` |
| centre, on G | the character panel: the live body, the stat ledger, the four gear pieces | `drawCharPanel` |

All three widgets slide **their own size** away for the landing intro — the rail up by `RAIL_SLIDE`, the strip down by
`HUD_SLIDE` (`AB_H` + `POUCH_RISE` + 5), the top-left corner left by `CORNER_REACH` (the widest
row a tool can have plus the SHIFT plate off its end) — because a shove that only cleared the
tool cell would leave a longbow's row parked over the cinematic.

### Market notices: the plates under the minimap

The market's own voice on the HUD — the `market notices` banner in [js/ui/shop.js](../../js/ui/shop.js),
raised by `marketNotice(kind, txt, good)` and drawn by `renderNotices()` from `renderUI`. A price
spike, a price crash and a counter turning over each raise one, *as well as* the line they already
put in the [event log](#scoreboard-and-event-log): the log is the record of what happened to
somebody, and a price is not that — it is the state of the world your bag is about to be sold
into, so it belongs where the clock already is.

**One shape, read left to right, with no sentence in it**: the **mark** of what the news is, then
what it is about, then one 8×8 glyph carrying which way — an arrow up or an arrow down.

The mark is the kind's own (`NOTE_KIND[k].mark`, a `SPRITES` key or null), 16×16 in a sunken well:
the merchant's **gold sack** (`SPRITES.goldSack`, ten frames turning over on `NOTE_FR` (0.11 s) the
whole time a **price** plate is up, so the coin keeps catching the light) and a still wooden
**crate** (`SPRITES.crate`) when the counter itself has turned over — a sack of coin is what a
price is worth, a crate is what a delivery *is*. A stock plate has **no tail**: its crate has
already said which kind of news this is, so the headline takes that 8 px instead.

What it is about is the good's own item icon and the price it landed on, **sized together** —
`runW(s)` measures the pair at a scale and the icon is drawn at the text's own, so a 2× price
carries a 16×16 icon and both drop to 1× together if a headline is too long for 2×. An 8 px icon
against a 10 px number reads as a footnote to it, and these two are one reading. `NEW STOCK` names
no good, so it is text alone.

The plate is a fixed `NOTE_W`×`NOTE_H` (78×22) card — 78 is what the content well needs, 16 px of
icon and 3 of gap and the 22 of `60G` at 2× over the 30 the mark's well and the tail's gutter take
— and `noteCard` is the whole
of what makes it read as a stamped tag rather than as a rectangle: a shadow offset under it,
**corners notched** off (`noteBox`, which draws the shape as three bands), a lit top edge and a
shaded bottom one for the bevel, an opaque dark base under the kind's wash, a 1 px frame in its
accent (`noteFrame`), a sunken well behind the mark, and the kind's ink **draining along the base**
as the plate's own remaining life — the only place its 8 s is written down, and it is written as a
length. Text is the `drawPixelTextShadow` font, because the whole plate fades and an outline
stamped under a `globalAlpha` goes blotchy ([CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md#hard-rules)). `NOTE_KIND`
holds the three palettes and is handed straight to `logEvent` as its colour override, so the plate
and the feed line can never disagree about which way a price went.

`noteRect(k)` places slot `k` off `MM_*` — right edge flush with the disc's own, `NOTE_GAP` (18 px)
under its rim, so the column follows the minimap wherever the size dial and the view put it and
never lands on the clock. **The newest plate is player 0**, hard under the disc, and its
arrival pushes the stack down: it flies in `NOTE_SLIDE` (30 px) off the right edge over `NOTE_IN`
(0.55 s) while the plates below ease down a whole `NOTE_PITCH` on that same curve. They are drawn
**oldest first** so the newest lands on top of the stack it is shoving.

**The arrival is a beat, not a fade-in.** There is no alpha ramp: the plate is opaque from its
first frame and a white **flash** covers the pop instead — `NOTE_FLASH` (0.45 s) of three pulses
under a decay, the first a near-white card and the two after it the plate blinking as it slides
home. The frame goes white whole while the field only washes to 0.85, because past the opening
peak the card still has to be readable — a flash you cannot see through is a blink. The exit is
the entrance run backwards, sliding the same `NOTE_SLIDE` back out to the right as it fades, so
the corner reads as one lane rather than as things dissolving in place. `ageNotices(dt)` runs the
whole clock from `updateFx` on wall time like the feed's lines — `NOTE_LIFE` (8 s), leaving over
the last `NOTE_OUT` (1.2 s), at most `NOTE_MAX` (3) on screen. The timings are long on purpose:
this is news you are meant to look *up* for, and a third-of-a-second slide is over before a glance
can land on it.

They draw **above the counter and the character sheet** (a price that moved while you were
standing at the shop must not arrive behind the panel it is about) and stay up while you are
down, like the feed — the market does not stop for a death. They duck under the map and settings
panels, and the end screens own the frame outright. Each kind carries its own cue:
[audio](gameplay.md#audio).

### The hover tooltip

One panel, bottom left, saying what the pointer is on — and the fourth deliberate carve-out from
show-don't-label, recorded as such in [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md#ui-rule-show-dont-label). What
earns it: a tool's rate of fire against a bit's weight is a **comparison of numbers**, and no shape
compares numbers. It is a carve-out and not a licence — every well still has to read at a glance
with the panel shut, which is what the tier plates, the shelf's pips and the cooldown wipes are for.

It is bottom **left** because that is the corner the pointer is furthest from while it hovers the
backpack, the weapon strip or a wiki row, so the panel never sits under the hand reading it.

**`tipAt(mx, my)` is the only source**, and it asks the same hit-testers, in the same order, that
the mousedown handler does — the character panel's gear wells, then the shelf, then the
weapon strip, then the backpack —
so what the panel describes and what a click would do can never be two different things. A live
drag outranks all of them: whatever is on the cursor describes itself. It answers in two modes
only, `play` and `title` (the wiki's ARSENAL rows); every other mode returns null.

`tipResolve()` runs **once per frame in `render()`, before `renderUI`**, so every draw in the
frame reads the same answer.

A descriptor is `{ title, tcol, kind, rows: [[label, value, col]], notes: [[text, col]], icon,
plate, rim }` and `drawTooltip` is the only thing that knows how to paint one: the icon on its own
**tier plate**, the name in that tier's ink, the kind under it, then label/value rows with a dotted
leader between them — the PLAYER panel's ledger, which is where that pattern already lives — and
free lines under those. The panel sizes itself to its widest line (capped at `TIP_MAXW`), so a
short tooltip is a short panel.

The builders, one per kind: `tipTool` (rate of fire, bit slots, max weight, then the loaded bits in
**firing order** with `>` on the one up next), `tipBit` (damage, weight, speed, lifespan, flight —
then only the flags that are *true*, because four rows of NO would drown the three that matter),
`tipStack` (food, cards), `tipGear`, `tipClassAb` (a strip
ability well in play, or class select's stage wells with `cls` passed — the in-play cooldown
and cast-hint rows only appear in play), and `tipKind` (a wiki row), which strips the "what is loaded in it"
half and ends on whether this profile has ever held one.

### The wiki screen

`m.screen = 'wiki'`, entered from the main menu's WIKI plank and eased in on its own `wikiT`
(the chrome ducks under it the way it does under class select). One surface: the title and its
gold rule, then a translucent frost slab (`drawMenuSlab`, up to `WIKI_W_MAX` = 400 wide,
`WIKI_H` = 200 tall, centred, narrowing with the view) with a **tab bar** of pages under its top
edge in the settings slab's navbar grammar — the open page in gold over a gold underline, the
rest dim until hovered — and a **content window** under a rule that the open page scrolls
through when it outgrows it: the wheel, up/down (W/S), and an iron rail on the right with a gilt
thumb (`drawWikiRail`; clicking the rail pages). Left/right (A/D) or a click switch pages; ESC
leaves. What the pages say is [gameplay.md](gameplay.md#the-wiki).

A page is data. `WIKI_PAGES` is `{ id, label, build() }` and `build` returns the page's
**blocks** top to bottom — `line` (a sentence), `rule` (a gold rule), `head` (a section name
with its column heads over their columns), `row` (a kind on its tier plate with its numbers in
the columns, `WIKI_TOOL_COLS` / `WIKI_BIT_COLS` / `WIKI_MOD_COLS` naming each column's label,
width and getter), `legend` (the deer wearing the overhead frame, a leader from each part of it
to its name), `beast` (a kind standing on its snow beside its growth table, `WIKI_BEASTS`),
`cls` (a class card: the body at 3x, pitch, health and the stat pips, `WIKI_STATS`) and `ab`
(an ability: key plate, the strip's icon in a well, name, the `WIKI_AB_COLS` numbers, the blurb
wrapped by `wikiWrap`; hoverable, answering `tipClassAb`) —
each with a fixed height, built once (`wikiBlocks`). `wikiLayout()` is the single source of
every rect: the slab, the tab cells, the window, each block's y (pre-scroll), the scroll bound,
the rail and its thumb; `wikiHit(mx, my)` reads it back as a tab, a row (carrying its kind id,
which is what the tooltip asks for) or the rail, so the hover, the click and the tooltip can
never disagree. Per-page scroll lives in `wikiScroll` beside the settings slab's `setScroll`;
the open page is `menu.wikiTab`. A new page is one table entry and one builder.

`drawWikiBeast` draws a kind exactly as `drawAnimal` hangs its frame in the world — the same
`drawHealthBar`, `drawLevelBadge` and `drawSenseMark` calls at the same offsets over the same
sprite, on a low snow mound — so the page teaches the frame by showing it, and a change to the
frame in the world changes it on the page. A camp monster's leash bar is shown part-filled, since bare
track says nothing. An ARSENAL row is the kind's icon on
the tier plate a bag cell wears (`tierPlate`, `modPlate`, `tierShine`), rimmed and lifted a pixel
under the pointer, the blue pip for `PROFILE.techSeen`, its name in the tier's ink, a dotted
leader to its numbers. Nothing here is bought or pressed: a click only opens a tab or pages the
rail.

### The hud strip

`drawHudStrip` is one plate, flush to the bottom — the [hud frame](#the-hud-frame) — carrying **four 34px wells** —
`[1][2][3][4]`, the class abilities in key order (`stripCellRect`; `abCellRect(i)` is well `i`;
the weapon left the strip for [the shelf](#the-weapon-shelf) in 3.23) — then, on the
right end, the **pouch block** (`pouchCellRect(col, row)`: a 2×2 of 24px squares, berry over
fish, gold over cards, its bottom flush with the wells' and its top `POUCH_RISE` (14) px above
the strip on a tab of the plate, `pouchTabRect`) — all over the
**plum xp bar** along the bottom (lifetime gold, left-to-right, no level number — that lives on
the overhead badge). The bar has a dark silhouette and a frost rim so it reads against the
plate, and is **notched into `AB_SEGS` segments** WoW-fashion — a tick cuts dark plum through
the fill and sits faint on the empty track, so progress through a level is countable either way.
It sits at the *bottom* so the strip's top edge stays open screen for the ability wells'
**floating buy plates** (below). The plate swallows clicks so nothing fires through it. There is
no rail: the dodge pips it once carried are said by the overhead stamina bar.

The weapon's well is [the shelf's tool cell](#the-weapon-shelf) now (`drawShelf`, top-left; the strip's
own well went in 3.23), and it says three things and carries no words. The **plate** behind the icon
is the tool's tier colour — the same colour it wears in every other well it ever sits in, so a
tier is stated once and stated the same way everywhere (`tierPlate`, and `tierShine` sweeps a
highlight across the top tier's plate); the 12px tool art is drawn doubled, so the tool
reads at the ability icons' size. The **rim** is that tier, quiet at rest and
brightened to the tier's ink on hover — the four ability wells' own grammar. It used to go white
and the whole well used to sit a pixel proud, as the tell for the SELECTED slot; there is one
weapon slot (`TOOL_SLOTS`), so that highlight could never turn off, and a highlight that is always
on is not a highlight — it just made the strip's left end shout over four wells that had something
to say. A tool that cannot answer the button still goes red, which is the old dry-bow
tell — and now the only reason this well ever leaves its resting colour. And the **cooldown sweep** ([below](#the-cooldown-sweep)) turns once through exactly
`toolCycle`, so the rate of fire is the speed of the hand rather than a number — and the veil
clearing IS the bow being ready, since nothing else gates the draw
([the cycle](gameplay.md#the-cycle)). It is the same hand the ability wells turn: a press waits on
the weapon's clock and on the key's, and the two are one question asked of different clocks, so
they are answered in one shape. What is loaded
stays out of the resting well — the [shelf](#the-weapon-shelf) over the backpack is where the
build is read and edited.

A fifth thing, and the only one that is an *event*: the well takes a **red band all the way round
it and the pack's own 1px shake** for `toolFlash` seconds when a bit has nowhere to go in the
tool ([one click sends it](gameplay.md#the-bit-column)) — `toolDenied()`, the twin of `bagDenied()` in
the same red and aged in `updateFx` beside it, so the two containers refuse in one language and
the one that is full is the one that answers.

An **ability well** (`drawClassAbCell`) is the same grammar pointed at `CLASS_AB[p.cls][i]`: its
detailed 32px icon (`classAbIcon`, baked from `AB32` in js/abilities.js) is the ability, a
**sweep** round the well is its cooldown (against the level-cut `abCdOf`, not the table base —
see below), and the key
digit sits big at 2× in the bottom-left corner (the keybind-indicator carve-out). Along the top
inner edge, fat gear-style **buy pips** on dark seats count the points in the key — one seat per
level it can hold, `AB_LV_MAX` of them, the first being the unlock
([gameplay.md](gameplay.md#class-abilities-keys-1-4)). A key with no point in it is **locked**,
and the well says so in the meal button's own grammar: dark rim, the icon at `LOCK_DIM` (0.28),
an empty pip row and a grey key digit — dim, never absent, so the strip never rearranges and you
can read what you have not bought. A press on one is refused with the same red band and 1px
shake the tool well and the meal buttons refuse in (`abDenied`, aged in `updateFx` beside
`toolFlash`/`foodFlash`); a cooldown is NOT that refusal, because the sweep already says when it
comes home. The ASK lives off the well: while a
skill point is unspent and the key has room a **floating buy plate** bobs in the open screen
above the well
(`abBuyRect`, a fixed hit rect the drawn bob stays inside; `abBuyHit` gates it on `abLvCanBuy`
AND `hudHome()`, so the plate's existence IS the appears-then-goes ask; `drawAbBuyPlate` draws it
under the same two gates
— a gold-rimmed plus, lighting on hover, the tooltip carrying the numbers). The `hudHome()` half
matters because the plate hangs in open screen ABOVE the strip: the intro's 40px slide is not far
enough to carry it off the bottom with the wells, and a **drop brief pins `state.intro`** for the
whole roost tour (the brief's camera branch in js/sim.js never counts it down), so without that
gate four gold plus plates bob alone along the bottom edge for the length of the cinematic.
`hudInT()` is the one answer to "how far in is the HUD", shared by `renderUI`'s slide and both
gates. Pressing the plate buys the level,
pressing the well casts — two surfaces, so neither can steal the other's click, and the well's
rim carries combat states only. On top of that it
tells the ability's moments: the rim goes **white while the body
performs the cast**, a **running** ability (the shield up, the fury out) pulses the rim in its own
colour (`acol` in its table row) and drains a bar of it along the bottom edge — the sweep waits
while that state runs, because the shield resets its cooldown on the drop and a hand turning under
a raised shield would be a lie (`activeF` in the table row is the readout) — and the well **pops
white** the frame a cooldown comes home. A click on the well sets `input.ability` exactly as the
key does (`hudPress`), and hovering it raises the ability tooltip (`tipClassAb` — the live
cooldown, level and next-level price, the blurb, nothing the well itself already shows better).

#### The cooldown sweep

`drawSweepCover(x, y, w, h, frac, col, edge)` is League's radial cooldown **cut to a square**, and
the **one readout the shelf's tool cell and the four ability wells share**: the
veil fills the well and retreats **clockwise from 12 o'clock**, so the dark that is left is the
wait that is left and the hand's angle is the fraction at a glance. That is the whole reason it
replaced the top-down wipe: on a 20 s clock a bar three quarters down and a bar half
down look alike in the corner of an eye mid-fight, while a hand at 4 o'clock and one at 7 do not.
One grammar over the whole strip — the weapon's rate of fire and an ability's cooldown are the
same question asked of different clocks, so only the speed of the hand tells a 0.8 s bow from a
20 s fury.

The **meal clock** turns it too (`drawFoodClock`, and with it the last top-down wipe in the game
left): both meal buttons off the one shared `p.foodCd`, so the two turn **together** — which is the
thing that says it is one clock and not two. It scales further down than it looks like it should,
which is why the gate stayed after the 8px surfaces it was written for went away: `drawFoodClock`
passes `CD_EDGE` only at `w >= 12`, and below that a cell turns the **bare veil** — the same wedge
sweeping the same way, minus a stroke that at that size lands ACROSS the berry and reads as a
scratch on the fruit rather than as a clock over it.

Two things it does not do the obvious way. It is **rasterised a pixel at a time**, for the reason
`mmRing` rasterises every curve of the minimap ([UI panels are baked once](#ui-panels-are-baked-once)):
a canvas path anti-aliases, and a soft diagonal across a 32px well is blur on a screen where every
other edge is hard. Unlike the minimap's chrome this one **cannot be baked** — the hand moves every
frame — so it pays the two costs that made `mmRing` the game's largest single cost, and dodges them
on size: the well is 32×32 (1024 angle tests, not a 68px disc's 4624 × several rings), each row is
walked once and its covered pixels coalesced into ONE `fillRect` per run instead of one per pixel,
and only a well actually on cooldown is walked at all. Measured on the bake path over repeated
runs: **28–37 µs a well, 0.14–0.19 ms with all five turning** — around 1% of a 60fps frame,
against `mmRing`'s old 1.6 ms.
And the veil is **not** the near-black cover the old top-down wipes used (`rgba(8,12,30,0.82)`,
deleted with the last of them) but a translucent slate (`CD_SWEEP`):
the well's ground is `#080b1c` and half of every icon is nearly as dark, so a darker-still wash
over it changes nothing the eye can find, and the sweep would be a bare line turning over a well
that never dims. The slate drags an icon's lit pixels down and lifts its dark ones to a blue-grey,
so the waiting wedge is a different **material** rather than merely a darker one — which is what
League's grey veil is actually doing. `CD_EDGE` draws the hand itself, centre to rim, in the 1px
bright line the old wipes carried at the front of their cover; pass `null` instead and the cell
turns the veil alone. The pips and the key digit are
drawn **after** it: the wait is what the veil is for, and what you own is never dimmed by it.

The **pouch block** (3.23) is the strip's right end: a 2×2 of `FOOD_SQ` (24 px) **squares** —
**berry** over **fish** on the left, **gold** over **cards** on the right — standing on a tab of
the strip's own plate (`pouchTabRect`: rimmed on top and sides, open onto the strip) whose
bottom row is flush with the wells and whose top rises `POUCH_RISE` (14) px above the strip's
edge, so the block is a small panel on the strip's end rather than four bars squeezed into one
well. Every square is drawn by `drawPouchCell` in the ability wells' own grammar at two thirds
the size: the item icon **doubled** in the middle (the card fan is baked at 16 px and draws at
1×, so all four carry art of one size), the key cap in the **bottom-left** corner, where an
ability well prints its key (the keybind-indicator carve-out, wearing the pad's own glyph while
one is in hand; the gold has none), and the count in the **top-right** corner — `shortNum`,
because the pouch has no ceiling, and a four-character count covers the icon's corner rather
than moving it — so keys read along the strip's bottom edge and numbers along its top.

Three of the four are **buttons** (`FOOD_BTNS`: berry, fish, cards, in `stripHit`'s `food`
order; the tab counts as on the strip for the hit test): hover lights the rim, a press sets the
same edge-triggered intent the key does (`eatBerry`/`eatFish`/`useCard`), so `startEat` and
`useCard` speak every refusal and a button can never disagree with its key. A refusal *shows*:
whatever the reason (none in the pouch, the clock still up, full health, a busy body, nothing
to draw), the button that was asked takes the well's red band and the pack's 1px shake for
`foodFlash` seconds — `foodDenied(type)` / `cardDenied()`, aged in `updateFx` beside
`bagDenied()`/`toolDenied()`. The shared food clock (`drawFoodClock`) sweeps both meal squares
together and lifts the one being chewed white; the card button has no clock. A kind you have
none of keeps its seat but dims to 0.35, so the block never rearranges. The **card button**'s
icon is three cards fanned — white, green, blue, each a step up and over from the last
(`cardFanCv`) — and its count is every rarity together; hover raises `tipCards`, one row per
rarity held in that rarity's ink, which is the only place the hand is read by kind. The **gold
plate** (`drawGoldCell`, `goldCellRect`) wears the same rim as its three neighbours, so the
block is one symmetrical thing, but it is a readout, not a button — no key cap, no hover, no
refusal — which is what marks the one square you cannot press; `stripHit` answers `frame` over
it and `tipGold` gives the exact figure — inked `#f5c542` because the one number on the HUD
that is money must never read as a count of something carried.

### The team rail

`drawRailScaled` (the `team rail` banner, js/ui/rail.js; 3.33) is the roster
along the top edge: two [hud frame](#the-hud-frame) plates, `RAIL_MID` (10) px apart, centred on
`VIEW_W` at `RAIL_Y` (3) — **your side on the left** and the rival's on the right, a 14px
**chip** per active player (`railLayout`: `RAIL_CHIP`, `RAIL_GAP`, `RAIL_PAD`) — the class's
12×12 emblem (`CLASS12`/`classIcon12`, js/ui/menu.js: drawn by hand beside `CLASS32`, never a shrink
of it) on the `BAG_WELL` ground in a rim painted by side through `skin()`. `railSides` orders
each side by id and puts **you first**, with your emblem baked white — the maps' own "you"
(`drawMapYou`). A chip carries exactly one bit, in the wells' own grammar:

- **up**: the side's `mark` rim, the emblem lit;
- **waiting**: a dead player with `respawnT` running — `drawSweepCover` lays the `CD_SWEEP`
  slate over the emblem with the `CD_EDGE` hand walking round from twelve, `respawnT /
  respawnTime(p)` of the way, exactly as an ability well waits; the rim goes to the cooldown's
  dark blue;
- **out**: `eliminated`, or dead with no countdown (its bird already driven off) — the rim dark,
  the emblem at `LOCK_DIM`.

No hp, no name, no number: "three of us are up, two of them are down for a while" is read by
counting lit chips and glancing at the hands. Under the pointer a chip's rim goes white and the
[tooltip](#the-hover-tooltip) carries the words (`tipRail`, through `railHit` in `tipAt`): the
name in `playerTint`, the class, the level, and the countdown or OUT while the body is down — the
scoreboard's own line. The references agree on the shape: Helldivers and Fortnite stack text-free
squad rows, none of the three puts an enemy frame on the HUD, and League's one enemy read is the
death timer — the right plate is that timer made a hand. *Where* anyone is stays the minimap's job.

It is drawn straight after the minimap in `renderUI` (under the counter's wash with it), rides
the intro slide up by `RAIL_SLIDE`, and **stays up while you are dead** — the side's state is
what a spectator reads, so the spectate control (`specLayout`, js/ui/screens.js), the camp plate and the
DAY headline all hang `headlineY()` under `railBottom()` (14 from the top when there is no rail:
the practice arena, or a match with an empty side — `railSides` is null and nothing draws), and
the two notes step under the spectate control as well while it is up (`noteY`).
**Its scale is a whole number**: `railSc` rounds the HUD SIZE dial and never goes under 1 (a 12px
emblem at 0.8 drops two of its rows, where a 34px well shrugs it off), capped where the plates
would reach a phone's zoom pair (`RAIL_KEEP`, 80 px each end on `MOBILE`) or the view's edge;
the bake is blitted about the **top-centre** anchor and `railMouse` maps the pointer back through
it. A known overlap: a longbow carrying five modifier bits stacks five rails above the shelf row
that reach `x` ≈ 270 at a 1.25 HUD, under the rail's leftmost chips.

### The hud frame

`drawHudFrame(x, y, w, h, o)` is the one plate the strip and the pack stand on: the frostlands'
chrome — the settings slab's chamfered corners and bevel (`bakeFrostSlab`, js/ui/panels.js) and the
menu planks' snow cap (`drawMenuButton`, js/ui/menu.js) — at a combat surface's volume, with none of
their mottling, rivets or icicles, because the wells cover most of the ground and a plate looked
at for an hour has to stay quiet. Four pixel layers: the **silhouette** (`HUD_INK`, the xp bar's
own ink) with its top corners cut two pixels and the corners that meet a screen edge left
square (a notch of world there reads as a hole; `o.corners`); the **ground** (`o.bg`, `AB_BG`
by default); the **bevel** — `HUD_LIT` along the top and left, `HUD_SHADE` along the bottom
and right; and the **snow cap** — a ragged one-to-two pixel drift on every top edge the sky
reaches, with the odd frost pixel sunk into the lit line under it, deterministic off `o.seed`
through `hash2` so it never shimmers (`o.cap: 1` keeps it one pixel for an edge something
already stands on, `false` drops it). `o.tab` is a block rising off the top edge and flush
with the right side — the pouch block's — and the frame draws the two as **one silhouette**:
the outline steps up around the tab, the ground runs through the seam, and the lit line turns
the inside corner and climbs it. `o.lit`/`o.ink` are what a widget's states colour (the drawer's
full amber, a refusal's red). Every margin inside the outline is three pixels — line, light,
ground — which is what `AB_PAD` and `BAG_PAD` are, so a well sits the same distance from the
edge on every side of both widgets. The [drawer](#the-backpack) wears it with every corner cut
and no cap: it lives under the shelf, not under the sky.

**One well size for the HUD** (3.23): the strip's wells and the shelf's cells are `HUD_CELL` (34)
square, and every item icon in them is drawn doubled (`drawItemIcon`'s `k`), so a tool reads at
one size on the shelf as an ability does on the strip. The drawer's cells are the exception on
purpose — `BAG_CELL` (18) with the art at 1× — because a spare is glanced at and dragged, not
read all match.

The whole widget — plate, wells and buy plates — draws at the **HUD SIZE**
the ESC panel's GAME slider holds (`settings.hudScale`, 0.75×–1.5×, default 0.8×). All geometry stays in 1×
strip space: at 1× everything draws straight to the frame, and at any other size `drawHudScaled`
bakes the widget into `hudScaleCv` and blits it scaled about the strip's anchor
with smoothing off, so the art scales nearest-neighbour instead of every fillRect going soft.
Every hit test (`stripHit`, `abBuyHit`) maps the pointer back through
the same anchor via `stripMouse` first, so a click can never land beside its pixel. **`hudSc()`
caps the dial** at the size where the strip would outgrow the view, so past that point the
slider simply stops growing it rather than pushing its ends off the screen. **The top-left corner
scales with the same dial**: `drawCornerScaled` bakes the shelf and the drawer at 1× and blits
them about the top-left corner (sized by `CORNER_REACH` and the drawer's height), and `bagHit`
and `shelfHit` map the pointer back through `cornerMouse`. While the slider's knob is in hand,
`renderSettings` draws the strip and the corner live over the slab — the minimap slider's
preview grammar.

The strip's **upgrade** half is entirely the floating buy plates above these wells — a skill
point is spent nowhere else, and nothing else on the strip is ever bought.

### The weapon shelf

**The one weapon, top-left, on screen at all times** (3.23): the tool in hand at the left end of a
row (`shelfCellRect(-1)`, at `SHELF_X`/`shelfRowY()`) and its bit cells running right in firing
order, which is the one place the [whole of a press](gameplay.md#toolplan-one-activation-in-one-pass)
is on screen at once — and the whole of what the HUD says about the arsenal, since the strip
lost its weapon well and everything else carried is in [the drawer](#the-backpack) under this
row. `SHELF_CELL` (`HUD_CELL`, 34), `SHELF_GAP` 2, pinned by its TOP to `shelfRowY()` (18; 44 on
a phone, under the menu and zoom plates) and its LEFT to `SHELF_X` (`BAG_PAD`, so the drawer's
frame under it sits flush with the view's edge) and grown rightward, so the tool cell — and the
drawer's arrow under it — never move whatever the build does, and a fitting's rail is what climbs
into the open screen above them; the SHIFT plate hangs off the row's right end (`shelfRowRight`).
It is **not a panel**: bare wells with their own drop shadows (`shelfWell`), so the corner
stays world everywhere between them and only a cell itself answers `shelfHit`. The tool cell is
the weapon's one well now, so it carries every tell the strip's used to: the **sweep** of the
rate of fire (`drawSweepCover`, the same hand the ability wells turn), the dry-bow red when the
tool cannot answer the button, the refusal red (`toolFlash`) when a bit will not fit, and the
"!" when the build weighs more than a press can spend.

Five marks, no words, all off `toolPlan`:

- the **row** is the press, left to right out of the tool: cell 0 leaves first;
- every cell carries its **weight** as pips along its bottom — on modifiers too, since a fitting
  costs the press what a shot does, and the [hatched plate](gameplay.md#tiers-and-how-a-find-reads) is what still
  tells the two kinds apart;
- every cell **past the cut** (the first one the budget could not reach) goes red-rimmed and
  washed out: it is carried, not thrown. Dead weight is a property of where a bit *sits*, never
  of the bit;
- a **rail** over the row runs from each fitting to the last shot it reaches, in that fitting's
  own colour, with a blip over every shot on the way that it is really in the envelope of
  (`shelfRails`, off each shot's `mods`) — the forward-only rule drawn rather than written.
  Rails stack upward with the LAST modifier nearest the row, which is what keeps them untangled:
  a rail's stem drops to its own cell through rails that all start further right, so no stem ever
  crosses a line. Each gets a 1 px dark seat, for the reason world text is outlined. Hovering
  either end lights the pair — the rail, and the shots it lands on, rimmed in its colour;
- the **gold bar** in the gap left of a cell is the lead shot: what the next press puts in the
  air first, and what the aim line on the ground is drawn for. On cell 0 that gap is between the
  tool and its first bit, which reads as the tool feeding it;
- under the bit cells the **budget** is a track filled in the tier's own ink to what this press
  spends of the tool's tensile, its tail left red when the row weighs more than the tool can
  swing.

That, and nothing written down, is the whole of "bow tensile strength".

And **two events**, both on the one flash: `bitLit` is `{ cell, cells, t, col }` — the tool the
flash belongs to (held by *reference*, so changing weapons cannot leave a flash on somebody else's
cells), which of its cells are lit, how long is left and in what colour. `bitLitAt` ramps it, and
clamps, so a flash may outlive `BIT_LIT_T`; `bitLitCol` answers the colour. Both live in
js/tools.js, aged in `updateFx` beside the refusal reds, and both are the **local player's alone**.

- **A press** lights every cell it SPENT — the shots and the fittings that shaped them — white,
  fading over `BIT_LIT_T` (0.3 s), rails included (`fireTool`). A build is fired far more often
  than it is edited, so the press itself is where the row is learned.
- **A [tool swap](gameplay.md#where-tools-and-bits-come-from)** lights the WHOLE row — cell **-1**,
  the tool well, and every loaded bit — in the new tier's own ink for `SWAP_T` (1.1 s)
  (`swapFx`). The tool cell is the tell: a press never lights it, so a lit tool means one thing
  only, which is that the body itself just changed under you.

**A tool carrying more than one press can swing wears a "!"** (`drawOverWarn`, js/ui/hud-draw.js) in the
top-right corner of every well it sits in — the strip's, the pack's grid and the shelf's — a gold
triangle with a dark stroke, bobbing a pixel so the eye catches it on a strip that is otherwise
still. It is a warning and not a refusal: the build still fires along the row as far as the
budget reaches, and the shelf's budget track is where you go to see exactly where it stops.

### The backpack

**A drawer under the weapon shelf, shut until asked for** (3.23). The HUD shows one weapon —
[the shelf](#the-weapon-shelf) — and everything else a player carries is in here: the spare
tools a walk turns up and the bits no tool had a cell for. It is **invisible by default**: the
pack key (B; L3 on a pad) or a click on the **arrow** under the tool cell (`bagTabRect` is the
band it sits in and answers from: a plain small white chevron, rimmed a pixel dark like every
mark over the world, no plate, pointing the way the drawer will go) sets `state.bagOpen`, the
same again or ESC clears it, and the merchant's counter
holds it open while it is up because a sale is a drag out of it. `bagOpenNow()` is the one
answer everything reads; `bagEase` chases it on wall time over `BAG_SLIDE_T` (0.15 s,
`updateFx`), and the drawer draws sliding out from under the tab, clipped to the screen below
the tab's bottom edge so it emerges rather than fades. It answers the pointer only once fully
open; the arrow's band always answers. `endMatch` shuts it.

While that counter is up the **corner is drawn out of the counter's wash** — the whole frame goes
dark under `shopScrim` and the shelf and this drawer are two of the four things left lit above it
([the counter](gameplay.md#opening-it)) — so `renderUI` draws `drawCornerScaled` *after* the wash
in that case and before it otherwise. The corner's own reach is `cornerClaim()` across and `cornerBottom()` down, which is
what the counter's slab is pinned clear of.

The frame (`bagFrameRect()`, flush with the view's left edge a px under the arrow's band, its
first cell on the tool cell's own left edge, `BAG_W` wide) is **nothing but the inventory grid** (`BAG_CAP` 12 — two rows of
`BAG_COLS` 6): the tools and bits a build is made of, in **small cells** — `BAG_CELL` 18 with the
art at 1×, a third of a well, because a spare is glanced at and dragged, not read all match.
There is no numbers row — the two meals, the gold and the cards are the
[strip's pouch block](#the-hud-strip). The arrow never moves; its colour is its only state — gold
under the pointer, **amber** when no cell is free, red on a refusal (`bagDenied()`, aged in
`updateFx`, which also reddens and shakes the open drawer for `bagFlash` seconds).

Gear is not in this widget at all — the four pieces live on
[the character panel](#the-character-panel-g).

A grid cell holding a tool or a bit wears that item's **tier plate** rather than the default well,
so a find is read at a glance without a rarity word anywhere; a tool also counts its loaded bits
as pips along the bottom, in the corner a stack number would have used.

- **One background, one frame, no internal line.** Every part of the drawer is the same opaque
  `BAG_BG` inside the [hud frame](#the-hud-frame) the strip wears — its two free corners cut,
  the two on the view's edge square, and no snow cap, since it lives under the shelf and not
  under the sky.
- **Depth comes from the cells, not from panels.** Three tones say it without a line: a filled
  cell recesses to `BAG_WELL` *below* the frame's ground, an empty one sits *above* it at
  `#171f45`, and the ground itself is between — occupied / free / frame.
- **An empty cell is the *lighter* one**: it has no icon to show off, and free space is what the
  grid is being read for, while a full cell goes dark behind its item. A stack of one prints no
  number — an empty corner says it.
- **A click on a cell uses what is in it** — a bit or a tool by
  [sending it to the weapon](gameplay.md#the-bit-column) — resolved on the
  release so that a press which travels is still a drag. Putting a *carried* item down is on the
  release too, since 3.22.
- **A well answers when something lands in it**: a `WELL_LIT_T` (0.3 s) wash in the colour of what
  happened — blue placed, green merged, gold swapped, red refused (`drawWellLit`) — drawn last,
  over the item. The same four colours come back as a **ring** around the well under the pointer
  while something is on the cursor, saying what letting go there *would* do before it does it
  ([what a gesture answers with](gameplay.md#what-a-gesture-answers-with)); that ring is painted
  after the drag ghost and outside the well, because the ghost is exactly as big as the cell.
- **The drawer swallows every click over itself.** `bagHit` reports `tab`, `cell` or `frame`
  (anywhere else inside, inert but eaten).
- **The grid does not stop the sim.** It is HUD, not an overlay — the same deal the
  [M map](gameplay.md#the-m-map-does-not-pause) takes, only smaller.

The model behind the grid is in [gameplay.md](gameplay.md#inventory-and-the-backpack); the gear
table and what a buy does are in [gameplay.md](gameplay.md#gear).

### The character panel (G)

WoW's C key at this game's size: **G raises one slab in the middle of the screen and the sim runs
on live around it** — a light dim, no pause, and it swallows only its own clicks (`charHit` /
`charClick`, asked first by the mousedown while it is up). G again, ESC or the drawn X closes it.

LEFT: the **body as it stands right now** — the class sprite walking in place at 4×, wearing its
bought gear bands in their level materials (`drawGearMarks`, the same pixels every rival reads on
you in the world) with the held weapon beside it — under a header naming the sheet (the profile
name in the team's mark, the class and hero level beside it). Below, the **stat ledger**:
`GEAR_STATS` read off the **live kit** (`kitOf`), so gear levels, ability ranks and cards are all
already in the numbers — dotted leaders, label left, value right, the panels' text carve-out.

RIGHT: the **four equipped pieces**, head to toe — each a 32 px icon well (`gearIcon32`) with its
variant name inked in the piece's level material, gear's three buy pips, and the next level's
price (coin + number, gold when affordable, slate when not). An affordable well pulses its rim
gold; a **click on the well buys** through the same `input.cmd {kind:'gear', piece}` path the old
HUD row used, so the panel and the bots still share one entry point (`buyGear`). A maxed piece
goes quiet behind a gold rim. Hovering a well raises `tipGear` exactly as the old row did
(`gearHit` now reads through `charHit`, so the tooltip, the cursor and the click can never
disagree).

## Overhead health bars

Beside the bar sits the other thing drawn on every body alike: **`drawUnitStates(e, px, py, w, h,
now)`** ([js/abilities.js](../../js/abilities.js)) paints the net drape, the root's sprung jaws,
the fire and the mark's gold chevrons over whatever sprite is wearing them, taking the sprite's own box so
a rabbit, a worker bot and a player get the same four tells at their own size. `drawPlayer`
reaches it through `drawAbilityOnPlayer` (which adds the one a player alone can show — a raised
shield); `drawAnimal`, `drawBird` and `drawRobot` call it directly. **The
fire never washes over the body** — tongues off the crown and a lit row under the feet — because a
burning rival still has to read as the rival it is; the embers themselves are particles, thrown by
`updateBurn` rather than drawn here. What each state *does* is
[gameplay.md](gameplay.md#status-effects-one-set-for-every-unit).

**The three bars over a body are three colours, never three shades of one**: health in the side's
paint, stamina white, the draw meter gold (the palette is one block above `drawHealthBar` in
[js/draw/overhead.js](../../js/draw/overhead.js); the cursor's bow ring, the aim line and the mouse icon
read the same two golds, so "full draw" is one colour everywhere).
`drawHealthBar(cxp, topY, hp, maxHp, w, team, col?)` draws a small bar above every unit, always visible
— every player (in `drawPlayer`), animals (in `drawAnimal`), robots (in `drawRobot`), a hurt
building — **painted by side** (`barCol`): the team's `mark` through `skin()`, so it is blue over
you and your allies and red over rivals on your screen, and neutral gold (`BAR_NEUTRAL`, the WoW
grammar) over wildlife, the practice dummy and anything handed no team; `col` overrides the side
for the bars that are not health, every one hung under the health bar the way a player's stamina is
(3 rows down, sharing a frame wall; **health is always the top bar**, at the same height on every
animal): a camp monster's leash (`THREAT_COL` red, bare track at rest:
[gameplay.md](gameplay.md#camp-monsters-neutral-until-hit)), a deer's sprint and a
rabbit's dodge charge (both `STAM_COL` white, at the health bar's own width:
[gameplay.md](gameplay.md#wildlife)) — every second bar always worn, since **the level plate
spans both**: `drawLevelBadge(rx, topY, level)` is the one 7-tall badge a hero and a beast
share, hard against the bar backing's left column and growing left with the digits, so a
rabbit's frame is the player's frame at 8 px. An empty bar is bare track (`drawHealthBar`
paints no fill at zero; a living thing's last sliver of hp is still a pixel). Over the frame,
where the stun stars turn, an animal that has a player in sight wears the **noticed mark** —
`drawSenseMark`, the font's `!` under a dark rim, white on prey and threat red on a camp monster,
rising out of the head over its first tenth of a second and gone the frame the sight is
([gameplay.md](gameplay.md#wildlife)); the stars win while a stun runs. How full a bar is carries the
health. The old green → amber → red drain spent the rival's colour on "hurt", so a hurt ally
read as an enemy at a glance. **Birds are the one exception** — 3 hp means every hit is a kill, and
a bar over something that small is all bar; `drawBird` draws the sprite lifted off its own shadow
by `a.alt` instead, which is the only read on how high one is.
The overhead bar is the **only** player health display — the old top-left Minecraft-style hearts
were removed in the HUD redesign (their sprites are still baked, unreferenced). Above it sits one
more small meter — **the slot the hands report to**, and it carries three states that can never
overlap, since a meal puts the bow down and blocks the draw for its whole length: gold while
charging (`DRAW_COL`), one white blink (`DRAW_FULL_FLASH`, 0.12 s) and then pale gold
(`DRAW_FULL_COL`) at full draw — brighter, never a new hue: two discrete states, since a gradient
is unreadable at 14 px, and the hot orange it used to turn sat beside a red rival's bar as two warm
bars; slate while the renock runs, pale gold the instant it comes back (the bow's own ready colour
— white is the stamina bar's); and **heal green** filling
left to right while a meal is being chewed (`FOOD_EAT`, [Food](gameplay.md#food-the-meal-is-a-channel)).
All three are drawn for **everyone**, because each is a tell somebody can act on — a shot is
coming, a shot is not coming, a heal is coming and hitting them takes it away. The overhead stack
floats clear of the sprite: stamina plate at `py - 4` (white, `STAM_COL`, on every side — the one
bar with no side to it; every player, since the level badge spans both
bars), health at `py - 7`, that meter at
`py - 10` (inside the same frame, directly above the hp bar with a track-grey gap row, the mirror of
the stamina bar), and the player's name tag in team colour at `py - 18`, a clear row above the meter's
frame — **every** player, the local one included: the name is the profile's
([architecture.md](architecture.md#profilejs)), and yours is what the rest of the table reads over
your head, so hiding it from you alone would make it the one label in the game you cannot check. The backings are translucent, so each plate paints only its own rows - no overlap.

**The frame is centred on the body, and the bars pay for it (`FRAME_DX`).** Horizontally the frame
is a 6 px level plate hard against the 16 px bar backing — 22 px at one digit; the plate sizes
itself to the number and grows *left*, so a two-digit level (the cap is 12) overhangs the way
the stun plate does on the right — and it is the *frame* that has
to straddle the sprite, not the bars inside it. So the whole stack is drawn `FRAME_DX` (3 px) right
of the sprite's own centre: `fx = round(p.x - ex) + FRAME_DX` is the stack's centre column and
everything in it hangs off that, giving `cx-11 .. cx+10`, exactly centred on the seam a 16×16
sprite is centred on. Measured off the canvas: a 22-column run from −11 to +10, centre 0.

**The stun plate is deliberately not counted.** It is a transient annex sharing the bar backing's
right edge (`fx+8 .. fx+13`), so a stun makes the frame 28 px and overhangs to the right until it
clears. Sizing the resting frame around it is what made the plate lopsided in the first place —
the level badge is permanent and the stun plate is not, so the geometry follows the permanent one.
Drawing the stun plate **empty** at rest would square both states, but it parks a bar that is never
a bar over every head, which is worse than the overhang. Turn the
[centre column](#the-centre-column-hbmid) on under `.` before changing any of these numbers.

**The name tag is centred by `centreTextX`, on the body and not on `fx`.** It is not part of the
frame — it is a label on the model, so it takes the sprite's own centre. A glyph run is
an **odd** number of pixels wide at scale 1 (`pixelTextWidth` is `4n - 1`), so unlike the frame it
can never sit exactly on the seam — but it must at least sit on the same side of it every frame,
and `round(p.x - ex - w / 2)` does not: the half pixel the odd width carries lands on top of the
camera's own fraction, so which way it rounds flips as the model walks and the tag hops a pixel
left and right against a body that is holding still. `centreTextX` rounds the position first (the
once-and-only-once rule in [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)) and then steps back a whole number of
pixels, `w >> 1`, which puts the run's **middle column** on `round(sx)` — the column
[hbMid](#the-centre-column-hbmid) draws, so the overlay runs straight down the middle glyph. Use it
for any text centred over a model; free-floating text (damage floaters, wheel labels) is not
centred on anything and keeps its own maths.

**Every other bar in the game is centred on its model directly** — an animal's frame carries the
level badge too, but its bars stay on the body's own centre and the badge simply overhangs to the
left, the way a stun plate overhangs right, so nothing but a player needs `FRAME_DX`. `drawHealthBar(cxp, …)` centres an even-width bar on `cxp`, and
every caller hands it a true centre: `a.x - ex` for an
animal (whose sprite is placed at `round(a.x - w/2 - ex)`), `b.x - ex` for a robot, and the centre
of the **footprint** for a building — `sx + sh + (spr.width >> 1)`, which is where the sprite
centres itself, `+ sh` so the readout rides the hit shudder with the thing it belongs to rather
than holding still over a wall that is rocking. Bar widths are kept even for the same reason the
sprites are.

**The whole stack hangs off one `hy`**, not off `py` directly, for two reasons. It drops 6 rows
for a [prone](gameplay.md#prone-under-the-snow) pose, which starts that much lower in the same
16×16 cell — bars floating where a head no longer is look broken. And its alpha fades with
`concealOf(p)`: name tag, both bars, the level badge and the draw meter that says a shot is coming
all go with the cover, weighted so you keep a readable copy of your own (×0.55), your side keeps
most of theirs (×0.7) and a rival keeps none (×1, skipped entirely below 3%). A buried rival whose
draw meter still showed would make the whole thing pointless.

## Text over the world

White pixel text on a white snowfield is unreadable with a drop shadow, so everything drawn over
the world goes through `drawPixelTextOutline(ctx, text, x, y, color, outline, scale)` in
[font.js](../../js/font.js): the glyph stamped at the eight 1-px integer offsets in the outline
colour, then once in the text colour — a solid rim on every side, exactly 1 game px at any text
scale, no blur. The outline colour is the opaque `#0f1632` (the eight passes overlap, so a
translucent colour would stack unevenly). Sites: floaters (damage numbers, gold, `LEVEL n`),
the overhead name tags, the E and fish prompts, the radial-wheel labels, every number on the backpack
widget (the strip's food counts and gold, each bag cell's stack count, a gear cell's hover price),
the clock under the minimap, `state.msg`, the info stack, and the drop-UI text.
`drawPixelTextShadow` (a single bottom-right 1 px shadow) remains for text sitting on a panel,
plank or overlay — the settings/map panels, the main menu, the death overlay and the scoreboard —
where a full outline reads heavy. Checked at noon on open snow and at
full night. A line drawn under a `globalAlpha` fade must use `Shadow`: the outline's eight passes
overlap, so a translucent stamp stacks unevenly and the rim goes blotchy.

## Damage feedback

`addDmgFloater(x, y, amount, taken)` pushes a combat damage number into the shared `floaters`
array: **gold** for damage dealt (arrows, whoever fired them), **red `-N`** for damage the local
player takes (`damagePlayer`). Numbers of 10+
render at 2× scale, and each gets a small random x-drift so rapid repeat hits stay readable.
Floater entries carry optional `vx`/`scale`/`rise` fields honored by the floaters render pass;
plain `addFloater` entries default to the old look. Units also flash white on hit via
`drawSpriteFlash` (0.8-alpha overlay). Hits on **structures** intentionally get no numbers;
structures show flash, shake, and damage cracks instead.

## Debug overlays: hitboxes and routes

What the sim tests, drawn over what the art shows — the two are deliberately different (a tree's
canopy overhangs the tile above it; an arrow is tested against a circle at the *chest*, 6 px above
the feet), and every collision question is faster to answer by looking than by reading. One key:
`.` toggles `settings.hitbox` in **any** mode, beside F3 and for the same reason — the title
screen's world is live and a spectated match is someone else's feet:

| `settings.hitbox` | draws |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | nothing (default; persists under the profile like every other setting) |
| `2` | bodies (tile boxes, unit circles, projectile points, pickup radii) plus the route every walker is following |

Colour carries the kind, so there is nothing to label: **cyan** a wall to everyone (`isSolidTile`,
so a multi-tile building boxes each of its footprint tiles), **blue** open water — a wall to
animals and robots, a hole a player falls into — **green** the body circle
`moveEntity`/`separateUnits` push apart, plus a dot on the anchor point itself, **red** the circle
an arrow is tested against, **violet** a walk-over pickup or a click target, **gold** a projectile
(a point, never a circle), **pink** the model's own centre column (`hbMid`).

Every shape is read from the expression the sim uses, never a copy of the number — an overlay that
disagrees with the sim is worse than none, because it is believed.

### The centre column (`hbMid`)

The one shape here that is about the **art** rather than the sim. The overhead frame — health bar,
stamina bar, level plate — is the only thing in the game that has to line up with a *sprite*
instead of with a number, and nothing else on screen shows where a sprite's middle is; a frame
three pixels off centre is invisible until something draws the line. Every player, animal, robot
and building gets one: movers off the exact camera (`ex`/`ey`), buildings off the rounded one
(`ox`/`oy`) and from the centre of the **footprint**, which is what a structure sprite centres
itself over whether or not it is wider than its tiles.

Every sprite in the game is an **even** number of pixels wide and centred on the seam between its
two halves, so the true middle is a pixel *boundary* and no 1 px line can sit on it. `hbMid` draws
at `round(centre)` — the column just right of that seam — which turns the test into a count: a
frame that is genuinely centred has as many columns strictly left of the line as it has from the
line rightwards. It is dotted so the frame it is measuring reads through it.

**Reaches and sight ranges are deliberately not drawn.** `WORK_REACH`, a wolf's bite and a camp's ground, a
turret's acquisition ring, the bird flush, the fish catch: they were in an earlier version of the
pass and are out again, because they are wide enough to bury the 7 px circle the overlay exists to
show, and because a sight range is per-target (`seenAt`) and so needs a design of its own rather
than a ring. They come back on their own terms later.

Both passes draw **above `renderLighting`** — the only world passes that do — because a debug view
has to be as readable at midnight as at noon. Rings are rasterised by `hbRing` as 1 px world
pixels rather than stroked with `arc()`: a stroke is anti-aliased, and the world blit magnifies a
soft edge into mush. It plots the left/right extremes by row and the top/bottom by column, so the
ring closes at every radius and a fractional one (`PLAYER_R` is 4.5) is not rounded away. `hbLine`
is the same idiom for a straight run, and its `step` is what dots a planned route leg.

### Routes

`drawNavPaths` runs from the same place, one layer under the hitboxes, because a route is on the
ground and a body stands on it. It draws the **plan, not the walk** — the line leaves the unit,
runs through the waypoints it has left (`nav.i` onward), and ends in a box on `nav.gtx`/`nav.gty`,
the tile the unit decided to go to, which is the answer to *why is it walking over there*. The leg
it is on now is solid and the legs beyond it are dotted, so a route being followed reads
differently from one being replanned. One colour per kind of walker, as on the minimap: players
gold, a camp monster red, the rest of the wildlife green, a worker bot blue.

Most routes are one leg: `navTo` takes the straight line whenever `navLineClear` allows it and
`navSmooth` collapses the rest, so a chain of waypoints means the unit is genuinely going around
something. `DBG.showPaths` still forces the same pass on by itself, whatever `settings.hitbox` is.

**Everything that walks has one of these**, grazing and patrolling included — see
[wildlife](gameplay.md#wildlife). That is what makes the overlay readable: a line always shrinks
into its box and ends on the tile the walker actually stops on. It used to be that an idling
animal held a random heading on a timer with no `nav` at all, so there was nothing honest to draw
and it stopped mid-stride wherever the clock ran out; wandering is a routed goal now, so that
whole class of "line that never shrinks" is gone.

The two exceptions are the two things that don't walk:

| Not a walker | Drawn as | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a bird in flight | straight dotted line to `a.perch` + the goal box | it flies over the route grid, but the perch it's coming down on is a real decided destination |
| a fish | `hbArrow` — a barbed heading stub, teal, **no box** | it steers (`f.a`) and genuinely has nowhere it is going; a box would claim a destination that doesn't exist |

The arrowhead is the whole tell: **a barbed stub is a heading, a line ending in a box is a walk to
a decided place.** Keep that split if you add another mover — draw the box only when there is a
goal tile to put it on.

## Camps on the maps

A [camp](world.md#camps) is a *named* place, so it has to be legible on every surface
that shows the world. `drawCampIcon(g, C, x, y, col, rim)` is the shared stamp: the spec's
`icon` rects inside a 7×7 box, drawn once inflated by 1 px in a rim colour and once in the ink,
so the same glyph reads on parchment, on snow and over forest.

- **The minimap** (`renderMinimap`) draws the glyph for any camp inside the disc, in the
  spec's `mark` over a dark rim. No name — `WOLF DEN` is wider than the whole 48 px disc.
- **The M map** (`renderWorldMap`) draws the glyph plus the name in map ink under it — over it
  instead when a name already inked would run into it, since two sites sit a label's width
  apart — clamped
  to the map rect so a camp near the edge keeps its label. It opens mid-flight too (M in
  mode `drop`), where choosing between camps is the whole jump decision.
- **Arrival** — `updatePlay` keeps `state.loc` (`{ L, t }`) for the local player from
  `campAt(player.x, player.y)`, and `renderUI` shows a toast top centre for ~3.5 s whenever it
  changes: a dark plate ruled in the spec's `mark`, the glyph, the name at 2× and the `tag` under
  it. It fades in and out, so it uses `drawPixelTextShadow` (see
  [Text over the world](#text-over-the-world) — an outline stamped under `globalAlpha` goes
  blotchy). The **day headline** (`state.dayPop`, set by each dawn and the landing in sim.js)
  shares the spot but not the plate: bare `DAY N` at 2×, nothing else. It wants BOTH the fade and
  the outline text over the world demands, so the opaque outlined stamp is baked once per day
  number (`dayPopCv`) and the canvas fades. It steps under the location plate when both are up.

## The end screens

A match ends on one of two full-frame ceremonies — `renderVictory` in the `victory` banner,
`renderDefeat` in the `defeat` one — and they are deliberately **one composition drawn twice**:
both read their anchors from `winLayout()` (in the same `FRAME_H`-tall authored frame every other
screen uses, from `frameTop()`), so DEFEAT sits exactly where VICTORY sat, the side stands on the same stands
(`winStands`), and the rule and the tally land in the same bands. `deadLayout()` reads the same
`plankY`, so the planks sit under the tally on both. The stage (`stageY`, `bannerY`, `brazierX`,
`bannerX`, `gap`) is set **from the outside in** — the braziers as far out as the view allows, the
banners just inside them, the line of bodies taking what is left with a gap that closes on a narrow
view.

**When each is up.** A win goes straight to its screen (`endMatch('won')` → `state.over = 'won'`).
A loss does **not**: an elimination only dims the play screen, because the match runs on underneath
and you can sit and watch it, so a lost match ends when you stop watching — **LOBBY** on the death
overlay opens the defeat screen (`openDefeat()`, `state.deadView = 'defeat'`) and that screen's own
single **LOBBY** plank is the door out. A respawn-pending death's LOBBY still leaves directly:
nothing has been lost yet. `endScreen()` is the one test for "a ceremony owns the frame" —
`renderUI` and `replayShowing` both bow out under it (the recap would cover the
whole ceremony); the held-TAB scoreboard and the info stack still draw over both.

**The two timelines.** `WIN_T` and `DEF_T` name every beat, and the render pass and the sound cues
(`winCues` / `defCues`, called from `update`) read one table each so they cannot drift apart. The
win is clocked off `state.deadTimer`, already ticking since the body fell; the loss has
`state.defeatT`, started when its view opens, which may be minutes later. Any press before the last
beat calls `endSkip()`, which jumps the relevant clock to the end.

- **Victory**: white bloom → **VICTORY** dropping in a letter at a time (each landing white, then
  gold, kicking up snow) → the gold rule sweeping out → the stage rising: braziers, the two crested
  team banners, the three-tier dais and **the whole winning side** on it — every active player of the
  team at 3× in a mirrored line (`winStands`: the local player in the middle on the raised block,
  mates fanning out a rank at a time to the right and the left, each rank a beat after the last),
  wearing the gear it finished in, its name over its head in the team's mark → a crown falling onto
  the local player's head → four stat plates popping in with their numbers climbing from zero → the
  planks sliding up. Nothing is written under the rule: the stage is the headline.
- **Defeat**: the same beats inverted. A colder, heavier wash → **DEFEAT** *falling* in a letter at
  a time on an ease-**in** (it drops, it does not spring), flashing cold rather than white → a
  **frost** rule (`drawGoldRule` takes a `pal`; `RULE_FROST`) → the stage *settling* rather than
  rising: the braziers out (`drawDeadBrazier` — the same ironwork with ash on the rim and a thread
  of smoke), the same two banners **cold** (`winBannerCv`'s `cold`: the cloth chilled halfway to the
  wash through `mixHex`, gold gone to frost, moth holes bitten out of the alpha, frayed where the
  tassels were), a snow bank where the dais stood and **the whole losing side** standing knee-deep
  in it on the win's stands — no raised block — with the local player **prone and side-on** in the
  middle at the same 3×, an arrow planted beside it where the crown would be → five stat plates →
  one plank. Nothing under the rule here either: who put you down is the death headline's, and
  this screen is the side's loss, not yours.

**What they print** is one frozen object either way — `endSnapshot()` on `state.end`, taken in
`endMatch` because the match keeps running underneath and a total that climbs behind a tally which
already counted it reads as a bug. Its `roster` is the whole side, the local player first — name,
class and kit per player, a mate who is down at the whistle included — and is what both stages
stand. The four shared columns are gold / kills / level / clock; the loss puts its **placing**
(`4/6`, off `place`/`of`) in front of them. `drawEndTally` / `drawEndStatPlate` / `drawEndPlanks`
are the shared passes: each takes the ending's timeline and its accent pair (`WIN_ACCENT` gold,
`DEF_ACCENT` frost), so one plate tallies both. A plate is icon-and-number and nothing else — the
icon at 2× (the coin and the bow blitted at 16 px, the stamped glyphs at 2 px cells) beside the
value at 2×, so the row reads at a glance with no label on it. `dy` on the planks slides them
without moving the rects `deadHit()` tests, so a plank is only clickable once it has arrived. The
kit is read off the bodies themselves (`drawGearMarks` at 3×); the fallen one draws none — those
sit on the standing body plan (see `drawPlayer`) — and there is no kit strip.

The art is procedural, in the title screen's idiom — `drawWinAurora` (three additive curtains of
2 px strands across the top band), `drawWinRays` (stepped wedges walking out from behind the
champion, blocks rather than an anti-aliased triangle), `drawWinMotes` (gold and snow falling from
`hash2` alone, no array; `cold` drops the sparks for the loss), `drawBlizzard` (wind streaks on the
same no-array idiom, a second speed under the motes), `winBannerCv` + `drawWinBanner` (each
side's banner **baked once** — a 36×96 gold-bordered cloth with a lit fold and a shaded edge, a
pale chief, the `WIN_CREST` eagle displayed stamped at 2×, the team's diamond between two gold
rules, a gold chevron down the hang and a fringed swallowtail cut into the alpha, mirrored with
`flip` so both lit folds face the stage — then hung from a finialed iron rail a row at a time
under a ripple pinned at the rail), `drawBrazierIron` + `drawWinBrazier` / `drawDeadBrazier`,
`drawWinDais` (three tiers: the raised block the local player stands on, the side's step, the
inlaid base with its icicles) and `drawDefeatDrift`. The drift's profile is a
cosine under a flattening root: a plain cosine domes, and a dome leaves the ends of a body lying on
it up in the air. It is drawn twice, once behind the body and once in front, so the champion lies
**in** the snow rather than on a hill. `stampGrid(rows, pal, x, y, s, rim)` paints a char grid at
any cell size, the shape the [js/sprites/](../../js/sprites/) grid files author in, for the crown, the arrow and
the stat glyphs (`WIN_ICONS`) that never earned a baked sprite; the sprites the screens do use are
the champion bodies, `SPRITES.gearIcons`, `itemBow` and `itemGold` — that last one a **live
canvas** whose frame `stepItemIcons()` stamps in each frame, like every item icon that moves
([sprites.md](sprites.md)).

**The death dim** underneath is the third state, and it is not a ceremony: a wash, **YOU COLLAPSED
IN THE SNOW** at 3× (2× on a view too narrow to hold it) in the upper band — it is the first thing
to read and the match is still playing behind it, so it goes where an eye lands rather than over
the body that fell — a second line saying the match is over for you, and two planks. That is the
**elimination** only. **The respawn wait** is the fourth state and the lightest: no wash, no
planks, the camera already on an ally through the spectate strip, one line — **RESPAWNING IN Ns**
at the same 3× in the same band, the number live. Both open under
[the recap](#replay-the-last-four-seconds): the last four seconds fill the frame first (the
countdown reads over it; the dim, the headline, the planks and the spectate strip wait), and its
close box or ESC hands the frame to whichever of the two is underneath.

## Replay: the last four seconds

The `replay` banner keeps a rolling four seconds of what was on screen and plays it back while you
are **dead** or **paused**, in one of two shapes (`rpFull()`/`rpRect()`):

- **The recap**, on a **death** (a respawn wait or an elimination, once `deadReady()` — half a
  second of dim — has landed): the **whole frame**, the way a goal replays. The countdown reads
  over it on a wait; the spectate strip, the death dim, its headline and its planks wait
  underneath (`renderDead` returns early while `replayFull()`). A close box sits inside the
  frame's top-right corner (`rpCloseRect`/`rpCloseHit`, a 12 px plank with a cross that lights
  gold under the pointer), an **ESC BACK** prompt at its foot (`drawKeyPrompt` with the `esc`
  action, so a pad wears its B), and `deadKey` takes ESC, BACKSPACE, ENTER and SPACE as
  `replayClose()` — a pad's B and a finger's menu plate arrive as escape. `state.rpClosed`
  remembers, reset by every `endMatch`, so it opens once per death.
- **The window**, on **pause**: the **bottom-left corner** at `RP_W`×`RP_H` (160×90), under the
  pause planks.

Never over [the end screens](#the-end-screens).
It records pixels, not state, so it costs nothing to keep and re-renders nothing to play.

**Where each draws.** The recap draws in the game canvas: the capture is **one sample per game
px** (`RP_CAP_W`×`RP_CAP_H`, 640×360, is the frame itself), and drawn back at the frame's size
under the `devScale` transform, nearest-neighbour, every capture px lands on one game px — at a
1080p or 1440p fullscreen the UI layer and a zoom-1 world come back pixel for pixel. A window
whose view outgrows the cap gets the clipped capture scaled by one fraction on both axes and a
dark sliver. The corner window cannot do that: 160×90 *game* px hold a sixteenth of the view,
and the detail is gone before anything is drawn. The same corner of the *screen* is
`RP_W * devScale` px across (480 device px at a 1080p fullscreen's 3×), so its frame goes to its
own canvas, `#replay` (z-order above `#game`, `pointer-events: none`), positioned over the
window's rect by `layoutReplay()` — which `relayout()` calls, so it follows every resize and
fullscreen toggle, and which `renderReplay` calls again whenever the rect it laid out (`rpKey`)
is not the one `rpRect()` now returns. The game canvas draws only the plate, the frost rim, the
playhead and a low-res copy underneath, which keeps the window legible in a plain
`canvas.toDataURL()` capture (`POST /shot`) and is covered exactly by the overlay on screen. The
recap hides the overlay outright (`rpOverlay(false)`), which is why its close box and prompt can
sit *inside* the frame.

Fullscreen here is the browser's (F11), which fullscreens the document, so a `position: fixed`
sibling still renders. Calling `requestFullscreen()` on `#game` itself would render *only* that
element and the replay window would vanish — fullscreen the document, or move the overlay inside
whatever element goes fullscreen.

**The ring.** `replayTick(now)` runs once per frame from the pass order above and owns the clock
(one `Math.min(0.05, …)` delta feeds both the capture cadence and the playhead). While
`replayLive()` — mode `play`, the local player alive, and no overlay freezing the sim, i.e. exactly
the condition `update()` steps on — it blits the finished canvas into slot `rpHead` of one atlas
canvas every `1/RP_FPS` s and wraps. `RP_SECS` 4 × `RP_FPS` 30 = `RP_N` 120 slots, `RP_COLS` 12
across; `RP_RATE` 0.5 is the playback speed.

**Capture resolution is the frame's.** `rpTarget()` is the view in game px, clipped by the memory
cap (`RP_CAP_W`×`RP_CAP_H`, 640×360) and never an upscale. The canvas holds `devScale` device px
per game px, so every capture is a reduction by exactly that whole number (`rpAtx` keeps
smoothing on: nearest would sample one device px in nine and strobe an arrow in flight), and a
UI pixel or a zoom-1 world pixel — one uniform block of device px — comes back as itself. At a
1080p or 1440p fullscreen the capture is the whole frame, so the recap is **pixel for pixel**
and the corner window's overlay shows it at device resolution with nothing resampled. A window
that renders more rows than the cap loses the excess.

**A resize does not cost frames.** Each slot records the size it was captured at (`rpFW`/`rpFH`),
so a change in view or zoom changes what the *next* frames look like and leaves the banked ones
alone. If the new size needs a bigger slot, `rpEnsure()` allocates a larger atlas and re-blits
every banked frame into it at its own resolution — only ever upward, so dragging a window about
does not reallocate on every step. Playback resizes the overlay's backing store to whatever the
current frame was captured at (the CSS size stays put), which is why a replay spanning a resize
changes sharpness mid-loop instead of jumping size or losing its history.

**Memory** is `RP_CAP_W * RP_CAP_H * 4 * RP_N` at the ceiling — 110 MB, and the ring only grows to
what a given window actually captures (a small window stays near 12 MB). This is the price of a
recap that comes back pixel for pixel: it is the biggest allocation in the game, twice the 55 MB
baked ground. `RP_CAP_*`, `RP_FPS` and `RP_SECS` are the knobs.

**Per-frame cost while alive** is one `drawImage` at `RP_FPS`, straight off the finished world
pass. Canvas-to-canvas stays on the GPU; `getImageData`/`toDataURL` would stall the pipeline every
capture, so neither is used, and nothing is allocated per frame. The capture is always a
reduction (device px to game px) and runs with `imageSmoothingEnabled` on `rpAtx` — nearest
there would sample 1 device px in 9 and strobe an arrow in flight in and out of the recording.

**Playback.** `replayShowing()` decides; every fresh open restarts at the oldest frame. The
playhead advances `RP_FPS * RP_RATE` frames a second, so the four seconds take eight to watch and
then loop at 15 fps on screen. The window wears the standard `#35426e` frost rim with a gold
playhead sweeping the bottom — no label and no "REPLAY" string: a looping window under a sweeping
playhead is what a recording looks like. Because the overlay is a DOM layer it is **not** covered
by anything the game canvas draws, so `renderReplay()` hides it outright when the window is down
and mirrors `state.fade` onto its `opacity` — otherwise the replay would sit there through the
LOBBY fade-out.

`DBG.replay` exposes `{ cv, frames, showing(), full(), shot, slot, bytes, W, H, fps, rate, ov }` —
`cv` is the whole filmstrip, `full()` says the recap owns the frame, and `shot`/`slot`/`bytes`
report the live capture size, slot size and atlas cost, so a headless driver can check the
resolution without playing to a death; `DBG.replayClose()` puts the recap away.

## Scoreboard and event log

Two readouts of the **match** rather than of the world, in the `scoreboard & log` banner.

**The log is not drawn.** `events` is the last `EVENT_MAX` (12) lines the match wrote, newest
last, and `logEvent(txt, p, o?)` is the one interface every caller speaks — `p` is the player the
line is *about* and supplies its colours (plate `coatD`, edge `mark`, ink `playerTint(p)`), `o`
overrides them for a line nobody owns. The bottom-left feed that used to draw them went in 3.23:
a scrolling column of sentences on the play surface was the one thing there the
[UI rule](../../CLAUDE.md#ui-rule-show-dont-label) forbids, and the bottom-left corner is the
tooltip's alone now. The ring stays as the match's record (`DBG.events`) so a future readout — a
kill toast, a recap — lands on it for free. What gets logged lives in
[multiplayer.md](multiplayer.md#kills-and-the-event-log).

**The scoreboard** is held-TAB (`scoreboardOpen()`: `keys['tab']`, any mode but `title`, so it
works while dead and while riding the eagle) and is drawn per frame, not baked — every number on
it is live. `scoreGroups()` is the ordering: players grouped by team, teams ranked by their total
`scoreOf(p)` and players inside a team by their own, ties broken by team then player id. `scoreOf`
is **lifetime gold earned** (`p.xp`), not the purse — spending gold on a building is progress, and
it is the number levels already run on — while the GOLD column shows the purse, so a player that has
spent can sit above one showing more gold (its LVL column is the visible tell). A team stripe in
`TEAMS[team].mark` runs down each group, each row carries a faint team wash (stronger for the
local player, which also gets a gold `>`), dead players dim to 0.55 and gain an `OUT` tag. The panel
is `SB_W` (168) wide, its height follows the row count, and it is centred on `VIEW_W`/`VIEW_H`
every frame — no `relayout()` anchors, so it needs nothing on a resize.

## Cursor

The native pointer is hidden over the canvas and a **pixel-art cursor is drawn in-canvas** as
the very last thing in `render()` (above every overlay and the info stack), so it sits on the
game's pixel grid at every zoom level. `cursorInfo()` resolves the pointer state once per
frame from `mouse`, `state`, `player` (draw/flounder/roll), and what's under the pointer, and
both the pixel cursor and the browser-cursor fallback read from it. It returns
`{ kind, mode, dim, frac, nock, dry, amb }`:

- `kind` **arrow** — dead (off a plank), paused, map, and anywhere in the title/settings/wheel that isn't
  a widget; **hand** — over a live main-menu item (`menuHit()`, frozen planks stay an arrow), a death-overlay plank (`deadHit()`) or spectate arrow (`specHit()`), a settings widget (`settingsHit()`, shared with the click handler
  so hover and click can never disagree), a live wheel segment, or a control inside the backpack
  widget (`gearHit()` / `bagHit()`), a weapon or ability well (`stripHit()`) or a cell of the weapon shelf
  (`shelfHit()` — the strip's gold plate is a readout and stays an arrow, see [The HUD corners](#the-hud-corners)); **grab** — dragging a
  slider, **or carrying an item on the cursor** (`state.drag`, which outranks everything: the drag
  ghost *is* the cursor until it is put down); **hammer** — over a stump or finished structure
  (right-clickable; `dim` beyond the 60 px reach, except under the CLICK scheme, where the press
  walks there); **reticle** — everywhere else in play.
- Reticle `mode` (table `RETICLE`): **idle** white cross; **amove** red ring — the CLICK scheme's
  A is armed and the next left press lays the attack-move
  ([the click scheme](multiplayer.md#the-click-scheme); its rings on the snow are
  `drawClickMarks`, js/draw/marks.js); **lock** gold ring — E will work
  the object under the pointer (`workTarget()` is non-null: tree, rock, berried bush),
  dimmed when it is beyond `WORK_REACH`; **ice** the same lock in pale blue over bare ice;
  **hunt** amber breathing ring over an animal, a rival player or a rival robot (`unitUnder`,
  actions.js — the same boxes the CLICK scheme's right button picks a body by); **fish** water-blue ring over a fish; **bow** — while charging the ring closes as
  the draw fills and turns pale gold at full, like the meter. `dim` (50% alpha) also means tools
  are blocked right now: floundering in a hole, or mid-roll.
- Every reticle in play also carries the **selected tool's own state**, whatever the pointer is
  over, since the crosshair is where the eye already is: `nock` (0→1 over `toolCycle`) draws
  four gold corner marks falling inward onto the ring, and `dry` — an empty slot **or** a tool
  whose budget reaches no shot — drops the centre
  pixel and greys the ticks, a hollow crosshair. `amb` (buried, settled: the next shot is worth
  `AMBUSH_MUL`) grows a second segment out along each of the crosshair's **own axes** and warms the
  centre pixel to gold — deliberately on the cross, where the renock's marks are on the diagonals,
  so a bow that is both reloading and buried says two separate things at once. All three come from
  the one `ret()` helper inside `cursorInfo`, so no return site can forget them. See
  [the cycle](gameplay.md#the-cycle) and [Prone](gameplay.md#prone-under-the-snow).
- Sprites live in `SPRITES.cursor.{arrow,hand,grab,hammer}` (`CUPAL`, lit top-left, icy
  bevel) with one-colour `SPRITES.cursorShadow` twins drawn 1 px offset beneath; hotspots are
  in `CUR_HOT`. Reticles are procedural via `drawOutlinedRects()` (dark rim pass, then fill),
  which the aim line's markers reuse.
- `settings.pixelCursor` (default **on**, the CURSOR row in the ESC menu: PIXEL/BROWSER)
  switches to the native pointer; `applyCursorStyle()` then maps the same state to the
  nearest CSS cursor (`crosshair`/`pointer`/`grabbing`/`default`) and sets
  `canvas.style.cursor` only on change. `mouse.inside` (set by mousemove, cleared by
  `mouseleave` on the canvas and document) hides the drawn cursor when the pointer leaves,
  and `DBG.hideUI` hides it for captures.

## Main menu (title)

`state.mode === 'title'` is a real menu, not a splash: the sim's ambient half keeps running
behind it (`updateTitle()` steps animals and fish and advances the menu timers; players, arrows
and structures do not tick and `state.time` is frozen), snow falls as usual, and the camera is
driven by `titleCamTarget()` — a slow lissajous drift around the open interior that stays
`BORDER_MAX + 6` tiles clear of the forest. Everything lives in the `main menu` banner and on
`state.menu`:

- **Items** `MENU_ITEMS` (SINGLEPLAYER / MULTIPLAYER / PRACTICE TOOL / WIKI / SETTINGS —
  `menuFrozen(i)` is true for MULTIPLAYER always, and for PRACTICE TOOL until the profile has
  broken it open: frozen planks are drawn sealed under an ice glaze by
  `drawMenuButton(..., frozen)`, never selectable or activatable;
  arrow keys skip the iced planks and the hand cursor ignores them. Each frozen plank's
  `menu.hover` slot tracks the pointer instead of the selection and drives a cold shimmer —
  pale rim, a sheen sweeping the glaze, frost breath — and clicking one calls `iceRefuse(i)`:
  that plank rattles for `menu.iceT` (`menu.iceI` names which), hairline cracks flash from the
  struck point (`menu.iceX/iceY`, reseeded per knock by `menu.iceSeed`) and heal as it
  refreezes, and `menu.shards` ice chips spray and fall, to `SFX.iceKnock`. **PRACTICE TOOL's
  ice is breakable, and its art says so**: one crack web stands on that plank at rest
  (`ICE_FLAW`, a fixed point and seed in the plank's pixels, drawn every frame by the same
  `cracksAt` helper and on no other plank), so the hint that this sheet gives lives in the picture
  rather than a prompt; each knock there also leaves its own crack web standing
  (`menu.iceMarks`, the same helper), and the third calls `breakPracticeIce` —
  the whole glaze sprays off, `PROFILE.markPractice()` keeps the break, and from then on the
  plank is a live item whose activation is `beginPractice()` (the reroll's whiteout onto
  `?practice=1`, the [practice arena](world.md#the-practice-arena)). SINGLEPLAYER leads
  the column as the first live way in; MULTIPLAYER sits as a quiet coming-soon block;
  [WIKI](#the-wiki-screen) and SETTINGS are the two live utilities at the foot) plus
  the seed row (`SEED N` + an 11×11 die) as one more selectable, stacked
  `MENU_PITCH` apart from `MENU_Y0`. **`menu.hover` has one cell per rect** — items *plus* the
  seed row — and its length is a literal in core.js, a file that loads before `MENU_ITEMS`
  exists; the ease tops a missing cell up with `|| 0` because a short array went NaN and silently
  deleted the seed row when the fifth plank arrived. The slab (`MENU_SLAB_PAD` past each side of `MENU_BW`) and
  pillars (`TITLE_PILLAR_W`, `TITLE_PILLAR_DX`) size themselves to the rects; `menuLayout()` is the single source of rects for hit-testing
  (`menuHit()`) and drawing. `menu.sel` is the keyboard selection; the mouse only steals it
  when it actually moves (`menu.moved`, set by mousemove), so arrows and hover never fight.
  Up/Down/W/S move, Enter/Space activate, Esc/Backspace close a panel; `menuKey()` and
  `menuClick()` are the only entry points (`keydown`/`mousedown` route there in title mode,
  and `mousedown` re-reads the pointer position from its own event).
- **Dressing** (the Frozen-Throne-style frame, all procedural, every piece taking its alpha from the
  caller so it fades with the chrome): `drawTitleBackdrop` replaces the flat tint with one that
  weighs on the top/bottom edges plus a corner vignette, leaving the centre clear; `drawPillar`
  draws the two stone pillars `TITLE_PILLAR_DX` either side of the column (coursed shaft, frost
  at the base, snow-capped capital, an iron brazier whose flame flickers in the bowl — no
  circular glow); `drawMenuSlab` is the translucent slab with gilt corner brackets behind the items;
  `drawGoldRule` the gold rule with diamond finials under the logo (`SOFTFALL`, no subtitle) and
  under the select header; `drawEmbers` the sparks rising off the logo and the braziers. The logo
  gets a pulsing ember glow behind it and a 1px ice rim along its top edges. Pillars rise from
  below at boot and sink away with the items on play. `PATCH_TXT` prints bottom-right and the
  active character bottom-left (`drawCharTag`, js/ui/chars.js); both are click targets, and both ride the footer's
  fade so a panel hides them.
- **Buttons** are procedural frost planks (`drawMenuButton`): chamfered slab with hashed
  wood-grain, a snow cap along the top, icicles off the bottom, corner rivets and a gold rule
  when hot (no glow behind the hot plank - it lifts and warms only). `menu.hover[i]` eases 0→1 toward the selected item and drives lift (2 px, the
  shadow stays on the ground) and the warm fill; `menu.pressT`
  sinks it for a beat; the lift, warm fill and gold rule are the whole selection cue (no selector arrows).
- **Die** (`drawDie`): shows `1 + (SEED % 6)` (faces 1–6), cycles faces and jitters while hovered, tumbles while
  `menu.rolling`. Activating it (`rerollWorld`) starts a whiteout via `state.fade`
  (`{ a, to, spd, color, then }`, stepped in `update()`, painted after the info stack) and then
  navigates to `?seed=<new>` — `SEED` is a const everything closes over, so a new world is a
  new page. Boot checks `sessionStorage['softfall.reroll']` and lands with the fade
  clearing from white and the die still settling.
- **Panels** slide up from the bottom edge over the still-visible world (`menu.panel`,
  `menu.panelT` over `PANEL_SLIDE_T`, `menu.closing` on the way out); the menu chrome ducks to
  zero alpha underneath. SETTINGS is the existing panel via `renderSettings(now, { bare, slide })`
  (no dim, no minimap preview, translated by `slide`) — its widgets only take input once
  `menuPanelReady()`, so a click can never land on a half-slid row, and clicking outside the
  slab closes it. The help panel (`helpPanelCv`, controls + the rules of the frostlands) still
  bakes, but nothing on the title opens it any more (PRACTICE TOOL now boots the arena); PATCH
  NOTES is `patchPanelCv`, opened by clicking the `PATCH_TXT` tag bottom-right (`patchTagRect` /
  `overPatchTag`; the tag turns gold with an underline on hover): the frame is baked once, the
  entries (newest first, word-wrapped) into `patchNotesCv` as tall as they need, and render blits
  the `PN_H` window at `menu.patchScroll`. Past one window a pixel scrollbar appears (`drawPatchBar`:
  iron rail, gilt thumb, ice nubs) — wheel, Up/Down, the nubs (step) and the track (page) move it.
  The **character tag** bottom-left (`charTagRect` / `overCharTag` / `drawCharTag`, js/ui/chars.js,
  the mirror of the patch tag: the active character's in-world body, its name and a quill that
  gilds on hover) opens the [character screens](#the-character-screens) below.
  Any open panel ducks the logo to zero alpha.
- **Class select** (`menu.screen = 'select'`, entered by SINGLEPLAYER via `beginSelect`): ONE
  screen on its **own painted night** (`drawSelectBackdrop` — starfield, two additive aurora
  ribbons, a vnoise ridge over a pine line, a lit snow floor, stateless snowfall off the clock,
  the cinematic band; fully opaque at rest, so the live ambient world is never this screen's
  backdrop), laid out **the way a League lobby is**. `selectLayout()`/`selectHit()` (which
  answers `'play'`, `'gear'`, `'diff' + k`, `'slot' + i` or null) are the rect
  source for both drawing and the mouse. Down the **left** run your side's five **roster cards**
  and down the **right** the rivals' (`drawSelectRosters`/`drawSelectCard`, `SEL_ROST_X` from
  centre, one `SEL_CARD` well per player in player order under a rule in the side's paint): the
  player's 16×16 body in its look and `skin(team)` paint with its name beside it — names are text's
  job — yours gold-rimmed, a rival's
  **face-down** (the body as one flat shade through the scratch canvas) until the countdown turns
  it. Over the rivals' column sits their **difficulty meter**: three notches filled up to
  `settings.aiLevel` in the rivals' paint, the hovered one lifting (`menu.dhover`), the level's
  name (`AI_LEVELS`, js/ai.js — NORMAL / HARD / IMPOSSIBLE) printed once under them, gold and
  naming the notch under the pointer while one is hovered; a click is `setAiLevel`, which saves
  the profile's settings. **PLAY** wears the title's first plank in its exact place (`MENU_Y0`,
  `MENU_BW`×`MENU_BH`); the **stage** under it holds **your character** alone (`drawSelectStage`):  `MENU_BW`×`MENU_BH`); the **stage** under it holds the chosen class alone (`drawSelectStage`):
  the 48 px model (`SPRITES.portrait`, [sprites.md](sprites.md#looks-a-character-on-the-class-body))
  at 2× in your side's paint under a warm pool of light with a gold ring turning
  on the snow, the class weapon's own tool art at the hand, the name below with the class in
  small beside it, and its four ability
  icons in the strip's own wells (`classAbIcon`) — the kit is read here exactly as it will be
    worn, and **hovering a well raises the ability tooltip** (`selectAbilHit` →
  `tipClassAb(i, csel)`). **There is no class picker**: the class came with the character. The
  **character slots** flank the figure's left (`drawSelectSlot`, one `SEL_P_CELL` well per
  profile slot, a filled one wearing that character's body at 2×, the active one gold and
  walking, the others dim and warm on hover (`menu.chover`)); a slot click or the arrows
  (`selectSlot`/`selectStep`) make that character active — `activateChar` → `applyCharacter`,
  so the stage, the kit, the loadout and the ability wells follow it (`menu.csel` mirrors
  `player.cls` for the gear preview and the ability tooltip; `menu.cswapT` pops the stage). The
  **collapsed gear widget** (the four picked variant icons in a column) flanks its right, and
  clicking it opens the gear pop-up. Enter or the plank call `pressPlay()` — `setClass` locks the
  class and the **countdown** starts: `menu.countT` runs `COUNT_T` (5) seconds, the whole second
  left drawn in 4× gold digits over the plank (`drawSelectCount`, white the instant it changes,
  sinking through its second), `SFX.nock` ticking each one, the plank sunk throughout, and
  **one rival card turning face-up per tick** (`selectRevealed()`: the first on the press, the
  last on ONE, all of them once it has run out, and none at rest — a white flash as each turns).
  Gear stays open through the count (the widget still opens its pop-up, which shuts itself at
  zero); a slot swap is refused with `SFX.deny`; Esc/Backspace call it off (`cancelCount`)
  and, at rest, go back to the menu; **PLAY again (Enter, Space or the plank) skips the rest of
  it** — the second `pressPlay()` ends the count where zero would have (every card face-up, the
  gear pop-up shut). At zero, or on that press, `lockIn()` — `menu.lockT`, then straight to
  `beginDrop()` (the eagle ride, below). No instructional text anywhere on the screen.

### The character screens

Two more surfaces on class select's painted night, both in [js/ui/chars.js](../../js/ui/chars.js)
(the `characters` banner) on one ease (`menu.charT`; `menu.cscreen` remembers which of the two
is fading out): the **roster** (`menu.screen = 'chars'`, `beginChars`/`leaveChars`, entered
from the character tag) and the **create / customize screen** (`'create'`, `beginCreate(slot,
first)`). The store behind them is [profile.js](architecture.md#profilejs); `charsLayout()` /
`createLayout()` + `rowCells()` are each screen's one rect source for the draw, the hit test
(`charsHit`/`createHit`) and the cursor.

- **The roster** is the profile's three slots as cards across the middle (`drawCharCard`,
  `CH_CARD_W`×`CH_CARD_H`): the 48 px model at 2× on its light, the name in gold with the 12 px
  class emblem beside it, and the **ledger** under a rule — WINS / MATCHES / KILLS / DEATHS /
  DAYS / GOLD as icon, label, dotted leader, number (the character-panel text carve-out;
  `drawLedger`). The active card wears the gold rim; a card click makes it active
  (`activateChar`) and leaves; the quill bottom-right opens the customize screen on that slot;
  the X plate top-right (red under the hand) **deletes on the press** (`deleteSlot`), and
  deleting the last character reopens the create screen as a first launch. An empty slot is a dashed well with a plus in it,
  and a click there is a new character. Left/Right walk `menu.ksel`, Enter picks, Esc backs out
  (`charsKey`).
- **The create screen** opens on `menu.cedit = { slot, spec, first }` — slot −1 is a **new
  character pre-rolled** by `PROFILE.rollChar` (a winter word and a random look), a slot index
  is that character's copy for editing, and `first` is the fresh install (js/boot.js opens it
  before the title when `!PROFILE.hasChar()`: no CANCEL, and DONE lands on the title menu).
  Left: the model at 3× on its stage (`drawModel`, class select's light and ring), the 16 px body
  at 2× walking beside it (what the snow will show), and the **name field** under them (the
  buffer at 2× with a caret, capacity ticks, a refusal flooding it red — `menu.nameBuf` /
  `menu.nameShake`). Right: the option column (`CH_ROWS`), each row an 8 px glyph and its
  cells — the **class pair** first (the two `CLASS32` emblems; once the character exists the
  other one is dark under a padlock: **class is fixed at creation**), the two body-type
  silhouettes, the six skin-tone swatches, hair style as a chevron pair around count pips, the
  eight hair-colour swatches, beard and face as chevron pairs — with the **shuffle plate** (a new
  look, `shuffleLook`) beside the emblems. The model IS the preview: every cell repaints it on
  the spot. The screen **owns the keyboard** (input.js routes to `createKey` before its own
  shortcuts): letters are the name, Backspace edits it, Up/Down walk `menu.crow` (a gold tick
  breathes at the row's glyph while the pointer is off the page), Left/Right turn the row, Enter
  is DONE, Esc CANCEL. DONE (`createCommit`) dims while the name would be refused and rattles
  the field on a refusal; it creates (`PROFILE.createChar`) or updates (`updateChar`, which
  never takes a class), makes the result active and returns to the roster.
- Every plate here shares one grammar (`drawWell`): a dark drop shadow, a slate rim that
  lightens under the hand and goes gold when picked, a navy floor. Hover eases live in
  `menu.khover`, keyed by hit id.
- **Gear pop-up** (`menu.screen = 'gear'`, easing over the still-lit select screen on
  `menu.gearT`): a dim, then a floating panel in two columns (`gearLayout()`/`gearScreenHit()`).
  LEFT is the **live preview** (`drawGearPreview`): the chosen class walking in place at 4×
  wearing its four leather bands (every pre-match pick is the free level 1) with the class
  weapon at hand, and under it the **stat ledger** — one labelled row per number gear can touch
  (`GEAR_STATS`), real values computed by `gearPreviewKit` through the same `baseKit`
  (js/player.js) the sim's `refreshKit` uses, so the page can never lie. RIGHT is all 12
  variants as **32px icon wells** (`drawGearWell`, icons `GEAR32`/`gearIcon32` baked on the
  ability icons' palette), four rows of three: the picked one gold-rimmed, the keyboard focus
  (`menu.grow`, W/S rows, A/D or Left/Right picks) breathing corner ticks, and the hovered
  variant's name printed once under the grid. **Hovering an unpicked well writes its deltas
  into the ledger** — the current number steps aside dim and the would-be number takes the
  edge in green (better) or red (worse), covering the whole swap (what the old pick gave up
  too). **Picking plays on the preview body** (`pickGear` → `menu.gearFxT`/`gearFxSlot`): a
  white flash through the scratch canvas, gold sparks, the changed piece's band lit. ESC,
  Enter, the **X** in the corner, or a click anywhere off the panel close it back to select
  (`leaveGear`) — PLAY (and a running count) stays on the select screen behind it. The ledger's labelled rows are
  the PLAYER-panel text carve-out: comparing numbers is this panel's whole job. See
  [gameplay.md](gameplay.md#gear).
- **Entrance**: `menu.t` staggers the logo and items in at boot.
- **Menu exit**: `state.intro` counting down from `INTRO_T` (1.6 s) with `state.introLen = INTRO_T`
  is what dissolves the menu — `renderTitle` keeps drawing while it runs: the tint dissolves over
  the first 45 % and the chrome sinks away in the first 22 % — and the camera eases from
  `state.introFrom` with `easeInOut(1 - intro / introLen)` instead of the play lerp. `beginDrop`
  starts it (into the eagle ride); `beginIntro` (debug only, `DBG.beginIntro`) starts it straight
  into `play` with the player already standing in the world.
- **Landing intro**: the human's `landPlayer` sets `state.intro = state.introLen = HUD_IN_T` (0.7 s)
  with `introFrom` at the touchdown framing, so `renderUI` slides the HUD in (the left stack from
  the left, the minimap from the top, the backpack from the right and the hud strip
  up from the bottom) while the camera settles onto the play framing.
  The DAY 1 headline fires when that intro ends.

`DBG` exposes `menu`, `menuHit`, `menuClick`, `menuKey`, `settingsHit`, `beginIntro`, `beginSelect`,
`selectLayout`, `selectHit`, `pressPlay`, `cancelCount`, `setAiLevel`, `lockIn` and `layout()` (the live `SET_*`/`ROW_*`/`MM_*` anchors) for driving all of this headlessly.

## Eagle drop (mode `drop`)

Everything in the `eagle drop` banner. `beginDrop()` (from `lockIn`, or `startGame`/`DBG.beginDrop`)
puts every active player aboard **its team's bird** (`p.aboard`) and builds
`state.drop = { eagles: [red, blue] }` via `makeEagles()`: one base line from `makeEagleRoute()` —
**the map's diagonal, fixed for every match and seed**: RED (team 0) flies it from the top-right
corner down to roost in the **bottom-left** woods, BLUE the reverse to the **top-right**. Each end
is `diagEnd()`, the point `EAGLE_END` (2) tiles inside that corner's treeline as the seed grew it
on the diagonal — the **last wooded tile** out from the corner, so a bay in the border short of it
is still forest on the corner side (pure reads of `borderDepth` — no `rng()`, no `hash2`) — so the
dive past it always has forest to land in; both corners are guaranteed woods anyway by the
[roost disc](world.md#the-tile-world). `diagEnd` also returns the corner's **mouth** — the first
open tile past that last pine, the road's gate on the diagonal (`roadSpan`, the same rule) — kept
for the record; what `makeEagles` hands each bird as `e.mouth` is its spur's **junction**
(`roadNest(team)`, [the road](world.md#the-road)): the point on the road's centreline its spur
aims at, and the way in for every walker. The two birds fly it in **opposite directions**, each shifted
`EAGLE_LANE` (2.5 tiles) along its own right-hand perpendicular so the mid-route pass over the
map's centre is a fly-by, ~5 tiles apart, never a collision. `beginDrop` sets mode `drop`, snaps
the world zoom to `DROP_ZOOM` around its centre and starts the menu exit. Every rider gets a
**wing seat** (`p.seat`, dealt per team in `beginDrop`; `seatPos`
rotates the `EAGLE_SEATS` offsets — one on the back, two inner wings, two out on the primaries —
by the heading, and the human sits seat 0 of their own bird); the team's **merchant** rides the
neck (`MERCH_SEAT`, drawn by `drawEagle` ahead of the riders — see
[the merchant](gameplay.md#the-merchant)). Every flight takes exactly
`EAGLE_FLIGHT_T` (10 s) — each bird derives `e.spd` from its own line's length — and jumping is
**locked until the line's last `DROP_LOCK_T` (4 s)**: `dropJump` refuses (and `SFX.deny`s) an
unforced jump before then. The window's far end is `e.jumpEnd` from `lastOpenU` — the last point
on the line still over open ground (`borderDepth` + `DROP_EDGE_MARGIN` tiles clear), so **a forced
drop never lands in the treeline**; `e.jumpOpen` is the lock's fraction, clamped under it.
`updateDrop` (called from `updatePlay`, so pause stops it) runs
`updateEagle` per bird, keeps every rider glued to its seat (`seatPos` at `eagleScale(e)`, the
bird's drawn size — 3× in flight, 2× on the ground), and force-drops each **AI** player at its
`p.dropU`, a hashed fraction of the jump window (scattered ±4 tiles off the line). **A human is
never force-dropped**: press Space/Enter/E/click inside the window and you jump (`dropJump` —
the fall starts **from the seat**, so the leap visibly leaves the wing); never press it and you
**ride the landing** — `beginDive` throws only bots, the dive comes down with you on its back
(`drawEagle` draws the seated riders through the dive and at rest), and `eagleCrash` calls
`landAboard`: `handOver` flips mode `drop` → `play` (the zoom, the camera, the HUD slide-in a
jump's `landPlayer` does), the ride's song is interrupted the way a jump interrupts it, and the
[drop brief](#the-drop-brief) opens with you still seated. When it hands back, the bird wears
the flight's gold landing ring again and `drawHopPrompt` raises the **HOP OFF** keybind
indicator (an E key cap — the pad's A disc while one is in hand — bobbing over the bird, one word
beside it); `p.input.work` or `p.input.dodge` (E, or the roll button: a pad's A) while seated on a
`down` bird calls `hopOff` (while seated, E is only that: the merchant standing beside the roost
never opens its counter over the hop, `keyPress`'s aboard guard in input.js) — a short low step off the wing (`HOP_FALL_T`, `HOP_ALT` — every
faller's arc reads `p.dropAlt`), steerable like any fall, landing on the nearest open tile beside
the roost. A profile that has **never jumped**
(`PROFILE.hasDropped()`, the drop-side gate of the `state.drop.firstFlight` flag) gets exactly
that ride with the jump refused — `dropJump` denies the local player's manual leap outright, so a
new player's first ground is the roost, beside the merchant and the gate, and the brief is always
the lesson. The first hop or any real jump (`PROFILE.markDropped`) retires the refusal for good.
A jumper free-falls for `FALL_T` (1.3 s), steering with WASD/arrows at
`DRIFT_SPD` (130 px/s, ~10 tiles over the fall) — `sampleHumanInput` keeps the movement axis alive in mode `drop` while zeroing
everything else; `landPlayer` then spirals out (up to 80 tiles) to the nearest tile with no object
and no water hole, which becomes `p.spawn` — the bot brain's home tile (a respawn moves it to the
roost) — with 2 s of i-frames and a snow
burst. Only the human's landing changes mode: `play` (closing the M map if it was up),
`applyZoom(0, true)` back to the player's own zoom centred on the landing, `shake`, and the
landing intro above.

### The drop brief

A local player that **rode the landing** — the scripted first flight always, or a veteran who
never jumped (a real jump is the opt-out) — sits through a camera tour of the two objectives
before the hop. `landAboard` (from `eagleCrash`) sets `state.dropBrief` (`{ ph, t, total }`),
and `updateDrop` runs the phases, rival first and your own last so the final word lands where
you are sitting: **`wait`** holds the crash you are in for `BRIEF_WAIT` (1 s); **`theirs-go`**
glides the camera across the map to the rival bird — the sim camera (js/sim.js) follows
`dropBriefTarget()` with the driven-off ceremony's own lerp, so a bird still finishing its dive
is *tracked* and the crash lands on screen — and holds until it is down; **`theirs`** holds
`BRIEF_HOLD` (3 s) under a two-line headline (`drawDropBrief`, baked opaque and faded as a
canvas, the dayPop grammar, on a **dark plate** — `BAG_BG` at `BRIEF_PLATE_A` 0.82 with the
team's colour as a 1 px rule top and bottom, because the roost is pines edge to edge and an
outline alone smeared into the needles) across the **top** of the view (`VIEW_H * 0.08`): `THEIR EAGLE` in
the rival's paint at **three times** the drop HUD's text scale over `DRIVE IT OFF TO WIN` at one
— the once the win condition is ever written down, the headline carve-out, and deliberately no
third line; **`ours-go`**/**`ours`** glide home and finish on your own roost for
`BRIEF_HOLD_OURS` (4 s) under `YOUR EAGLE` / `LOSE IT, LOSE THE MATCH`, then clear through
`endBrief()`, which also pops the `DAY 1` headline the landing owes (the camera banner in sim.js
holds it back while the brief has the top of the screen) — and from there the E - HOP OFF
indicator (above) is the way down. While it runs
`sampleHumanInput`
zeroes the controls exactly as the ceremony does, the M toggle is refused, `player.invuln` is
held up so nobody dies watching the lesson, and the match runs on underneath — the world is the
backdrop, not paused. `BRIEF_MAX_T` (24 s) is the safety rail, and `state.eagleCine` (or leaving
mode `play`) outranks and clears it.

**`state.drop` now outlives the whole match** — it never goes null, because the roosts are the
objectives. A bird's life is `fly → dive → down → flee → gone` (`e.state`): at the end of its line
`beginDive` throws any remaining rider and `findCrashPoint` lands on the side's **nest** —
`roadNest(team)` ([the road](world.md#the-road)): `ROAD_NEST_OFF` (13) tiles off the road's
centreline to the bird's own right, at the first junction inward from the gate where the spot is
deep (`roadNestDeep`: ≥`CRASH_DEPTH` (14) tiles inside the treeline by the border's own measure,
`forestDepth` = `borderDepth` − edge distance, **and** as far inside the corner's
[roost disc](world.md#the-tile-world), since `forestDepth` only knows the nearest world edge)
**and** whose 7×7 still holds ≥`MIN_CRASH_TREES` (40 of 49 — the border is solid, so fewer means
an edge or a bay) — the roost sits a proper way **inside** the woods with trees all round it,
never on the tree edge, RED's to the top-left side of its road, BLUE's to the bottom-right,
mirrored through the map's centre; should the spot have changed since worldgen the nearest tile
round it that still qualifies takes the impact, the blast ring always off the road (pure reads —
no `rng()`, no `hash2` — so a seed always buries its birds in the same trees). The stoop runs
`EAGLE_DIVE_T` (1.4 s, `u²`-eased, wingbeats quickening, speed motes streaming) and **banks**: the
heading turns from the line's to the crash's bearing over the first part of the dive
(`e.diveH0`/`e.diveTurn`, set by `beginDive`), so the turn off the road into the nest's woods
reads as a turn, and the roosting bird faces the way it came down. `eagleCrash` then clears every tree
within `BOOM_R` (3.6 tiles) outright and **paves the disc** (the pad: every snow tile in it turns
to ground `3` that frame and `addPad` registers it with the road, [world.md](world.md#the-road),
so the roost stands on the same packed earth as its spur and the road), snaps **two rings** to
stumps — the middle out to `BOOM_STUMP_R` (4.8), the merchant's turret sites, and the outer out to
`BOOM_STUMP_R2` (6.0), where its wall ring runs, so the walls stand outside the guns — and clears
every rock and bush out to the outer ring outright, so nothing sits in the wall's band that a wall
cannot replace —
**paying no gold**, a crater of free fells would warp the economy at minute one — plants the
**roost hitbox** (`eagle` objects on the open tiles within `EAGLE_TILE_R`, solid to walkers and a
rival-only E target; `eagleFlee` clears them again at liftoff), plans the **lane** and drops off
the **merchant** (below), and fires `eagleBoomFx` (snow + team-colour
bursts, hanging feathers, a radial dust ring, two shockwave rings squashed flat over `BOOM_LIFE`
so they read as a blast wave along the ground, never a halo), distance-scaled `state.shake`,
`SFX.boom()` (the timber sample dropped low under a synth blast, layered on purpose) and a
`HAS LANDED` feed headline — the landing is a landing, not a wound: the bird takes **no damage**
from its own dive. **The spur** (`planLane`/`laneStep`, `e.lane = { t, ev, next, pave, paved }`):
from the crater along `e.laneDir` — set by `eagleCrash` as the unit vector from the crash to
`e.mouth`, its **junction on the road's centreline** (`roadNest`), back the way the bird came only
if the junction is somehow under it — to the road's edge, every pine (and rock: `laneFells`)
within `LANE_R` (= `SPUR_HW`, 1.25 tiles — the paved track's own half-width) of the centreline
becomes two events timed by its distance along the spur, so a **felling front** walks out from the
roost at `LANE_SPD` (3.5 tiles/s) starting `LANE_DELAY` after the impact: each pine **shudders
`LANE_WARN` (0.5 s) ahead of the front** (`o.shake`, the parkour roll's own tell, decayed by
sim.js's object-timer loop), then goes down in needles and snow with a throttled `SFX.treeFall`
(a rock shatters to `SFX.break_`). It is the parkour's `pkAnimStep` grammar without the ice — a
watched transition, never a blink — and it pays nothing and leaves no stumps: a road is a road.
**Behind the front the band is paved**: `eagleCrash` registers the spur with the road
(`addSpur`, `e.spur`, [the road](world.md#the-road)), `planLane` lists every snow tile of the
band from the blast's rim (`BOOM_R`) to the road with its distance out (`pave`), and each
`laneStep` turns the tiles the front has passed to ground `3`, lifts any stump off them, advances
`e.spur.paved` and repaints the ground three tiles round each (`paintGroundTile`), so the track
grows at the front's own pace on the bake, both maps and every `onRoad` read alike. The spur is
done when the front is inside the road (`roadMainDist`; `LANE_MAX` (60) is only a safety) and
`e.lane` drops when the last event and the last tile are spent. Pure reads, so a seed's spur is
always the same spur; the merchant's gate and post read `e.laneDir` too, so the gate flanks the
track that was actually cut. `laneStep` runs from `updateEagle`'s `down` branch. The grounded bird
is the team's **objective**, and its hp pool is its
**nerve**: `EAGLE_HP` (2000, sized as a siege since 2.61, when the bots learned to go for it),
spooked down a flat `EAGLE_ARROW_DMG` (12) per rival arrow through `hurtEagle` (the sim.js arrow
loop tests the roost tiles themselves — *before* tile solidity, which would eat the shot — so the
arrow hitbox is exactly the collision box, corners included) and `EAGLE_WORK_DMG` (20) per rival
E swing (via `hitObject`'s eagle branch) — a lone warrior's E drives it off in about a minute under
the gust (2.63: a hundred swings, twelve gusts, 53 s), a pair in half that, but arrows alone take
minutes. It is not helpless: a rival inside `GUST_R` (64 — wide enough to cover a swing from the
next tile out past the roost's 3×3, which 44 was not; resolved through `seenAt`, like every
watcher) makes it rear — wings thrown open for
`GUST_WIND_T`, the whole telegraph — then `eagleGust` throws every rival in `GUST_BLAST_R` back at
`GUST_KB` with a `GUST_STUN` tumble and `risePlayer` (wind strips the snow off a buried body), on
a `GUST_CD` cooldown, dealing **no damage** — the objective punishes face-tanking, it never earns
kills. Left unhit for `PREEN_DELAY` it **preens**, recovering `PREEN_RATE` hp/s — the refilling
bar is the whole announcement, so chip damage must be pressed home. At zero nerve the bird is
**driven off, not killed**, and liftoff starts the **driven-off ceremony**, League-style:
`eagleFlee` clears the roost tiles, blasts the takeoff downdraft (`eagleGustFx` writ large,
`SFX.gust`), logs `WAS DRIVEN OFF` and sets `state.eagleCine` — the camera (its banner in
js/sim.js) glides to the fleeing bird and holds it centred, `sampleHumanInput` zeroes the local
controls exactly as pause does, `hurtEagle` refuses a second flee, and `checkLastStanding` waits.
`EAGLE_CINE_T` (3.2 s) after liftoff, `eagleFleeResolve` (ticked from `updateDrop`) puts the
owning side down permanently (`die(p, null, 'eagle')` / `teamEagleDown`, which `die`,
`updateRespawns` and `teamInMatch` all gate on — see [multiplayer.md](multiplayer.md#pvp)) and the
victory or defeat screen rises **over the escape still flying underneath** — the camera stays on
the bird through mode `dead` and only KEEP PLAYING (back to mode `play`) takes it back early. The
takeoff itself: over `FLEE_LIFT_T` the bird turns from wherever the dive left it pointing to
`fleeTo` (away from the world's centre, shortest arc) while climbing; then it flies at `FLEE_SPD`
until `FLEE_T`, when it is `gone` and draws nothing ever again.

Drawing: `drawDropAir` (above the world, below lighting) first dots **the flight path across the
snow itself** while mode is `drop` — each flying bird's whole line dashed in its team colour, dots
crawling toward the end so the line reads as a direction, with your own bird's jump window overlaid
in gold that brightens and pulses once the lock opens — then runs `drawEagle` per bird — the
`SPRITES.eagleShadow` silhouette `alt` px below and up to 10 px right of the body (`alt` is
`DROP_ALT` 56 px in flight, converging to 0 down the dive so shadow and bird meet at the crash
point), the bird itself in its team's armour (`SPRITES.eagleTeam[team]` cycling spread → mid →
back → mid, rotated to its heading, at `EAGLE_SCALE` 3× walking down to `EAGLE_REST_SCALE` 2×
through the dive, bobbing 3 px in level flight), under it the **wind trail** (`drawEagleTrail`,
drawn before the bird's own cull because it hangs behind a bird already off the frame): **one
continuous ribbon off each wingtip**, sampled every `TRAIL_STEP` (6) px back along the flown
line for `TRAIL_T` (1.1 s) of flight, each sample where the tip actually *was* on that beat —
the wing's reach and set follow the flap continuously (`TRAIL_TIP`±`TRAIL_TIP_AMP`,
`TRAIL_BACK`±`TRAIL_BACK_AMP`) and the body's bob — so the ribbon waves with the wingbeat and
hangs where it was torn while the bird flies on and the snow rushes away under it. It is solid
at the tip and fades to nothing at its tail: one linear gradient along the ribbon, a 3 px white
over a 5 px `TRAIL_RIM` dark line so white air reads over snow, the whole thing fading through
the stoop. Pure reads of the flight clock (`e.t`, `e.spd`, `e.flap`) — no particles, no sim step,
the same trail at any dt. Then **every rider seated on its wing** (`drawSeated`:
the pose set's direction picked by the heading's dominant axis — `riderDir`, so a crew flying
down-left shows its profiles — the bottom three rows tucked into the plumage so a body sits
rather than stands, the hem meeting the feathers at the seat point, lifted a pixel on the
downstroke; **world-sized** — `riderScale(e)` is the bird's own perspective, `eagleScale / 2`:
1× on the roosting bird, 1.5× in flight because the bird itself is 1.5× bigger up there, so a
body never changes size against the feathers under it; the merchant on the neck the same way; the
local player drawn last), and a pulsing gold landing ring
under the human's own bird — only while the jump window is open, so the ring never promises a jump
the lock refuses — then every faller: a `sin` **hop** off the wing
over the first quarter of the fall, then the shrink from `p.dropSc` (the seat's size as it left)
to 1× along
`alt = p.dropAlt·(1 − q²)` with a widening shadow. The faller cull is against `WV_*`, the world
pass rule — it was `VIEW_*` once, which is exactly why fallers in the far half of the zoomed-out
frame used to vanish mid-air. A `down` bird casts **no shadow** — it is on the ground, and a dark
copy under it read as a second bird — and folds its wings over `EAGLE_SETTLE_T` (the three
frames as a settle animation), then **rests**, breathing a ±1 px bob with a wing-shuffle idle
every 3.5–7 s (`RUFFLE_T`, mid frame only with a puff of settling snow — the full spread stays
the gust's telegraph, so the idle can never cry wolf), flashing via the baked
all-white `SPRITES.eagleFlash` when hit (it is taller than the 64×64 `drawSpriteFlash` scratch),
with its team-colour hp bar up **from the moment it roosts** — the bar is the objective's
introduction, anchored to the bird's rotated extent, under a `PERCH` nameplate in the same paint (its
driver wears `MERCH`: the side's two named bodies, named the same way). A gust windup draws wings thrown open
(frame 0) lifted 2 px: the spread IS the telegraph, no text. A `flee` bird climbs back out —
scale and `alt` walk from the roost's numbers to the flight's over `FLEE_LIFT_T`, the shadow
returning and diverging as the ground falls away, wingbeats at full panic — and fades over the
last 1.4 s of `FLEE_T`; `gone` draws nothing. `renderDropUI` (mode `drop` only) draws the
**flight bar**, top centre: the whole line as one track, the flown part filled in team colour
under the chart-style bird diamond, the **jump window as a gold stretch** (dim while locked,
pulsing bright once open — the lock is taught by the bar's shape, no sentence), seconds left as a
number beside it (gold once open); `WASD - DRIFT` while falling; and an `M - MAP` keybind indicator bottom right (`drawDropBind`: both wear the pad's left stick and BACK pill while a pad is in hand) —
the ride's wider read is the **M map** now (`renderWorldMap` also runs in mode `drop`, where it
draws each flying bird's line dashed in team colour with the bird diamond riding it; M/Esc are
handled in input.js's drop branch, the map swallows the jump click, and the sim keeps running
under it). Text scale follows the view (2× when tall). Once `down`, both objectives are marked on
the minimap disc and the M map as the same bird diamond in team colour.

Airborne players (`inAir(p)`: aboard or `dropT > 0`) are skipped by `updatePlayer`/`updateAI`, arrows,
drops, wildlife scares, `enemyOf`, the y-sorted draws, the minimap and the M map.

## Light and weather

Everything over the finished world frame, in world pixels, in `renderLighting()`
([js/draw/light.js](../../js/draw/light.js), the `light & weather` banner). It is the last world
pass; the debug overlays are the only thing above it.

**Nothing on the map emits light, and there is no light registry.** The `lights` array,
`rebuildLights()` and the offscreen `lightCv` are gone with the darkness they existed for, and so
is the player's personal glow. **Night is a colour**: a `multiply` of `NIGHT_TINT` at
`globalAlpha = state.darkness`, plus a little `NIGHT_DEEP` for depth. It cools and dims what is
already drawn instead of laying a slab over it, so snow stays snow, team colours stay legible at
midnight, and dusk eases into it off the darkness curve with nothing to schedule. A new glowing
object adds a pass here; it does not register anywhere.

The day half is two things, drawn in that order because a shadow falls across a sunbeam and not
the other way round:

- **God rays** (`godRays`) — **parallel** shafts of low sun on one heading (`RAY_ANG`, drifting on
  a long sine), and they are a **moment, not weather**. Low sun is the light of an arrival and of
  the top of the day, and a beam that is always there stops being a beam, so `rayLight()` gates the
  whole pass to two windows and it is dark the rest of the time: the **entire eagle ride** plus
  `RAY_AFTER` (4 s) past the landing — `landPlayer` stamps `state.rayT`, `updateFx` counts it down —
  and a **~15 s window around noon** (`RAY_NOON`, the middle of the daylight half). Both ease in and
  out over `RAY_WINDOW_FADE`. The gate is read *first*, so outside those windows the eight blits and
  the two hundred motes behind them never run at all. The practice arena's clock never moves, so
  its training light never gets them. The sun is far away; nothing here converges, and an earlier version that fanned
  them off a nearby origin read as a spotlight rather than as daylight. What makes a parallel set
  read as *beams* rather than as striping laid over the picture is the **length fade**: each shaft
  swells out of nothing, peaks about a third of the way along and **trails off** before it leaves
  the view, so it arrives from somewhere and dies in the air instead of running edge to edge. They
  are slim (`RAY_W`, a fraction of `WV_H`) and deliberately faint — on snow already sitting at 0.95
  a shaft that states itself is a shaft that has blown the ground out, which is why they read
  strongest on ice and on the treeline and barely at all on an open drift.
  Placement is done in the **rotated frame**: the view's four corners are projected onto the
  heading and its normal, and the shafts are laid across that span, so none is ever placed where it
  could not be seen. The set breathes sideways on a slow sine rather than drifting and wrapping —
  a wrap would pop a shaft into existence mid-screen — and each shaft is staggered along its own
  length and wanders a little off the shared heading, so the set never reads as a comb.
  The shaft is one **baked** 256×64 texture (`RAY_CV`) carrying *both* fades — a soft-shouldered
  cross-section and the swell-and-trail along its length — drawn scaled and rotated per shaft. That
  is why it is baked: drawn as gradient strips the length fade bands, and two gradients cannot
  multiply in one fill. Eight `drawImage`s carry the whole pass, against twenty-six full-width
  gradient fills in the first version, and it costs a third of what that did.
  The set is anchored to the **view**, not the world, and every dimension is a fraction of
  `WV_W`/`WV_H`. Crepuscular rays are air, not ground, so nothing about them should slide when you
  pan — and it means the shafts are composed identically at every zoom, which is what a
  world-anchored version needed a subdivision ladder to fake.
- **Dust motes** — the sparkle in the shafts, drawn by the same function, and the half of the
  effect that actually carries on snow. They live in **shaft coordinates** (`u` along, `v` across),
  so they can only ever exist where a shaft does and they drift *down* it rather than falling with
  the snow; they carry the shaft's own swell-and-trail, so a mote fades with its light. Their hash
  keys off the shaft's **index**, never its angle — the angle wobbles every frame, and a mote whose
  seed moves teleports instead of drifting. They are drawn `source-over` in warm **gold**, not
  additively in white: snow sits at 0.95 and has no headroom left to brighten, so a white additive
  mote over a sunlit drift is invisible while a warm speck reads. The biggest get a white core and
  a four-armed catch. ~180 of them a frame.
- **Cloud shadows** (`cloudShade`) — two tileable noise fields (`bakeCloud`) baked once at their
  **final world size** and drawn 1:1 through `repeat` patterns: no scaling, so no smoothing
  question and no seam. `pnoise` is value noise on a lattice wrapped per axis, which is the whole
  trick — it is what lets one 768 px canvas tile the entire 3712 px world. Fewer features across
  than down stretches the shade along its drift, which keeps it from reading as circles. The two
  periods (768 and 448) never come round together, so what crosses the field never visibly
  repeats. World-anchored and world-sized, so zooming in walks you *under* a cloud.
  **The mapping is the whole look.** A threshold with a narrow ramp gives a plateau of full shade
  inside a visible rim, and a screen of those reads as clip-art blobs sliding over the snow. So
  there is no threshold: `lo`…`hi` spans about three standard deviations of the field, so almost
  every pixel lands somewhere on the ramp and hardly any reaches either end — what crosses the
  ground is one continuous swell of dimming with **no edge anywhere in it**. `lo` sits just above
  the median, which keeps roughly half the sky genuinely open: a flat plateau of *clear* is fine,
  it is a flat plateau of *shade* that reads as a blob.
  **Contrast is set on the ramp, not by turning the whole thing up.** `CLOUD_CURVE` (a power > 1)
  bends the thin half of the ramp thinner, and `CLOUD_GAIN` then pushes what is left into the
  clamp, so open snow stays open and the deep part of a cloud is the only part that really
  darkens — the swing across the ground is what grows, not the average. Measured off the two baked
  textures at full daylight, as a percentage of the ground's own brightness left standing: the
  deepest 0.1 % of the field sits at **61 %** and the median at **97 %**, against 82 % and 98 %
  before the curve — a light-to-dark swing of **32 points against 13**, with the mean moving only
  97 → 94. That is the number to check when retuning it; the shadow tint (`CLOUD_TINT`, cool, never
  grey) is the other half of how hard it bites.
  **The practice arena is exempt** (`PRACTICE`): a shadow drifting over the dummy's meter or the
  parkour's ice would change what those instruments are measuring between one lap and the next, and
  that room's whole point is that its light never changes. (It gets no shafts either, for free —
  its clock is pinned nowhere near noon and it has no eagle.)

Then the dusk and dawn tints (unchanged), then the night multiply, then **`litShots`** — the one
light left in the game. A shot carrying a `lit` bit (the CARE ARROW, the WISP, anything a FLAME
modifier is riding — see [tools and bits](gameplay.md#tools-and-bits)) gets an additive warm
halo read straight off the live `arrows`, so it warms the night blue rather than cutting a hole
in it. It is drawn **after** the night grade, which is why it reads at midnight and barely at all
at noon.

### The reflected sky

`drawIceStars` is night's one bright thing, and the only place the stars are visible in a game
with no sky in frame: they are **in the ice**. Two halves, and the first is what makes the second
work at all.

**The mirror.** Sheet ice is painted at 0.72–0.93 brightness — most of the way to white — so a
white dot on it has almost no contrast, and the night `multiply` grades star and ice down together
and *keeps* it that way. There is no headroom to fix it with. So the ice itself goes **dark**
first: every intact tile takes a deep-blue wash scaled by `state.darkness` (`STAR_MIRROR`), which
is what a frozen lake at night actually looks like from above — a black mirror, darker than the
snow around it — and it is what gives the stars something to be bright against. Without it the
whole effect is invisible, which is exactly how the first version of this failed. Filled in
horizontal **runs** of adjacent ice, one `fillRect` per run rather than one per tile.

**The sky.** The stars do not sit *on* the ice, they sit in a sky reflected *in* it, so they are
anchored neither to the world nor to the screen: the field is sampled at `STAR_PAR` (0.22) of the
camera's offset, so it slides against the ground as you walk — a long way off, moving slowly,
which is the whole read of a reflection. The loop therefore runs over **sky cells** and asks what
tile each one landed on, not over tiles. A star draws only where it fell on **unbroken** ice
(`ground` 1 — `overIce()`, which every reflected pixel passes, the arms of a bright star's cross
included), so the field is cut to the shape of the lake and **an ice hole is a hole in the stars
too**. Each twinkles on its own rate, and the whole reflection ripples a pixel sideways on a slow
wave down the field, because ice is not a perfect mirror.

It is drawn **early** — right after the visible tile range is computed, above the under-ice fish
and the crack decals but under everything that walks, so a body standing on the ice covers its own
reflection — and therefore **under** the night multiply as well. That is deliberate: the same blue
that cools the snow cools the stars with it, which is what a reflection does.

## Drawing a thousand of something

**A `drawImage` whose source canvas differs from the last one cannot be batched.** The driver has
to change texture, so it becomes its own GPU draw call, and a wide-open view holds around a
thousand pines. This is the single largest performance fact in the renderer, and it is not about
pixels at all — measured on a GTX 1060 at 886×498 over the treeline, same scene, same sprite
count:

| what the pines drew from | fps |
| --- | --- |
| sixteen separate frame canvases, cycling | **97** |
| the same sixteen, frame pinned so every call hits one canvas | **199** |
| one canvas at 27×37 | 155 |
| one canvas at 16×24 | 152 |
| no trees at all | 205 |

Sprite **area is irrelevant** (155 against 152 for a sprite two and a half times the size). What
costs is the state change. So `SPRITES.treeAtlas` lays all twenty-four bend frames side by side in
one canvas — and then all twenty-four again mirrored, forty-eight in all, because half the forest
draws flipped and a wider atlas is still **one** texture —
with `fw`/`fh` riding on it, and `drawFrameFlash(atlas, frame, x, y, flash)` — the
atlas-aware twin of `drawSpriteFlash` — blits a source rect out of it. `SPRITES.tree` still exists
because the atlas is baked from it, but nothing draws through it.

**Anything new that the world can hold hundreds of has to do the same**, or it will quietly cost
more than everything else in the frame put together.

### Specks

The same rule, one level down: the sun's dust motes and the ice's reflected stars are hundreds of
1–2 px dots a frame, and a `fillRect` per speck with its own `fillStyle` and `globalAlpha` is a
draw call per speck. Collecting them into a `Path2D` per bucket was tried and is **worse** —
building and tessellating a path of 1 px rects every frame cost 1.0 ms for 240 motes, against
~0.05 ms for what replaced it.

What replaced it is `bakeSpecks(kinds, paint)`: one texture holding a cell per *(kind, brightness
level)* — `SPECK_LV` of them, ten — so `drawSpeck(atlas, kind, alpha, x, y)` picks the level by
alpha and the whole field draws from a single source with `globalAlpha` pinned at 1 and nothing to
change between calls. `MOTE_CV` has two kinds (a grain, and a bright one with its catch);
`STAR_CV` has six (three tints × plain/bright); `FLAKE_CV` has one per pixel size, because the
[snow](#snow) is sized by the zoom and at the widest rung there are 240 flakes in frame.
Quantising a twinkle to tenths is invisible on a 2 px speck.

### What this pass costs

Every one of these effects is **screen-bounded and reads nothing the sim writes** — the cloud and
ray passes fill the view and no more, `drawIceStars` walks only the visible tiles and the sky cells
over them, and every mote and star is culled against `WV_W`/`WV_H` before it is drawn. None of them
feed anything back: they are safe to cheapen, skip or reorder without touching a match — which is
exactly what the ESC panel's **VIDEO page** does: `settings.vidClouds`/`vidRays` gate their calls
in `renderLighting`, `vidStars` gates `drawIceStars` in `render()`, `vidSnow` gates
`renderWeather`'s draw (the sim still moves the flakes) and `vidVig` the frame vignette, so a
weak GPU sheds the whole dressing without touching the sim
([settings](gameplay.md#settings)).

Measured against `PATCH 2.02` — the build before any of this — by navigating one browser tab
between the two servers six times and taking the median, so the same GPU and thermal state
measures both: **191 fps before, 190 after, a difference of 0.03 ms per frame**. The atlas is what
bought that back; before it the same scene ran at 87 fps.

### The wind field

One field, in the `wind` banner of [js/sim.js](../../js/sim.js), and everything the
weather moves reads it rather than keeping a clock of its own:

- `state.windT` is its clock, stepped in `updateFx` — the **sim** clock, not wall time, so
  `DBG.step` reproduces a gust, a shaft and a twinkle exactly. Every animated thing in this
  section runs off it.
- `state.wind` is the field's strength, 0..1: `windAmp()` **squares the daylight**, so the air
  goes still across dusk and is dead calm by full dark. Two swells on coprime periods
  (`WIND_SWELL`, `WIND_SWELL2`) ride under that, so the day's weather never settles into a rhythm.
- `state.windDir` is which way the air is running, −1..1 — one answer for the whole map, because a
  prevailing wind is a property of the day and not of a tile. `windVeer()` steps it beside the
  strength: a sine on `WIND_VEER` (47 s) overdriven into its clamp by `WIND_VEER_HOLD`, so the air
  holds a steady quarter for most of a swing and crosses the still middle in about nine seconds.
  That is what puts a stand of pines over to the left for a while, stands them up, then lays them
  to the right.
- `windSway(tx, ty)` is the signed **lean** at a tile, −1..1, where +1 is a crown thrown fully to
  the right — a lean, not a phase, which is what lets a gust lay every tree inside it the same way.
  It is a **sum of waves on crossing bearings**, not one wave: a single travelling sine over a grid
  is a marching corduroy — straight, evenly spaced, every tree at full lean — which is the one thing
  air does not look like. Its three terms are the lean, the rustle and the arrival:

  ```
  s = wind * gust * (WIND_LEAN * windDir + WIND_RUSTLE * ripples)
  ```

  The **lean** is the DC push: a stand inside a gust bends downwind and is *held* there while the
  gust is on it, then eases upright in the lull behind, which is the part you actually watch cross
  the treeline. The **rustle** is the crowns working about that lean, multiplied by the same gust,
  so a tree in a lull barely stirs while one in the front is thrashing — and it is small enough
  against the lean that a gusted tree stays downwind of vertical the way a real one does. What
  crosses the field:
  - **three ripples** (`WIND_R1*`…`WIND_R3*`), each its own bearing as a `(kx, ky)` in rad per
    tile, its own speed and its own share of the amplitude. Two run with the prevailing down-right
    air and the third cuts across it. Their amplitudes sum to **1.44**, deliberately past 1: three
    waves at random phase mostly cancel, so a set summing to exactly 1 leaves the forest
    permanently half-hearted. The result runs through a **soft knee** at `WIND_SOFT` — under it the
    lean is linear, over it a rational curve eases toward ±1 without reaching it. A hard clamp
    there would *freeze* the worst-hit trees at full lean, which is the one moment they should look
    busiest.
  - **one bend** (`WIND_W*`), a long slow wave folded into the *spatial phase* of all three
    ripples at once — phase modulation, the trick FM synthesis is. It meanders the whole rustle
    together, which is what turns the plaid a plain sum of sines gives into wandering fronts.
  - **a gust envelope**: two waves an order of magnitude longer than the ripples (~56 and ~66
    tiles against ~18) on crossing bearings, summed and smoothstepped, running between `WIND_LULL`
    and `WIND_GUST_PEAK`. The sum is what makes a gust a *patch* of field rather than a stripe of
    it; the smoothstep widens the calm between gusts and squares up their shoulders. Both ends are
    set against the **view**, not the world: a screen is barely wider than one gust, so the floor
    cannot sit near zero (a player parked in a lull would be watching a dead forest) and the peak
    deliberately overshoots 1 so the heart of a gust runs into the soft knee and lays those trees
    right over. Their wavelength is set against the view too — about two screens each, so the near
    trees are already over while the far ones are still standing and you *see* the front travel.
  - **the arrival**: those two envelope waves are not sines. They run through `wskew`, which folds
    a wave's own value into its phase and leans it forward, so at `WIND_SKEW` = 0.7 a gust spends
    ~32 % of its cycle arriving and ~68 % dying away. A wind gauge draws that shape and a sine does
    not, and the asymmetry is most of what separates *a front hit* from *the forest is breathing in
    and out*.

  Sampled over a view for a minute of sim, a tile averages **2.34 frames** off upright, **3.4 %**
  are thrown 8 frames or more over (the heart of a gust) and **36.8 %** are within a frame of
  standing straight up — the motion distributed as gusts and lulls rather than evenly. Under
  `WIND_STILL` it returns a flat 0 and every pine simply stands up.
- `treeFrame(tx, ty)` (js/draw/ground.js) turns that into an atlas frame. The pine's frames are a
  **ladder** of leans, not a cycle of phases ([sprites.md](sprites.md)) — 0 thrown fully left, 23
  fully right, the middle upright — so the map is direct: `round(11.5 + sway * 11.5)`, **clamped**
  rather than wrapped, because at the end of its travel a crown stops rather than snapping back the
  other way. Every frame being the same tree now, two things off the tile's `hash2` keep a stand
  from reading as one stamp repeated: half the forest draws **mirrored** (the second 24 frames of
  the atlas — a mirrored tree's ladder runs backwards, hence the reversed index), and each tree
  keeps a **standing lean** of up to `TREE_REST` frames, which is what it is still wearing after
  dark.
- `wsin` is a 256-entry sine table, and it is why the field can afford to be six waves: `windSway`
  is read once per visible pine per frame and does eight lookups (the two skewed envelope waves
  cost two each), not eight `Math.sin` calls, and its answer is quantised to twenty-four frames, so
  a table is exact enough. The cost stays flat when a zoomed-out view is holding a thousand trees.
  Negative phases are fine — `|0` then `& 255` wraps them, at the price of a truncation a 256th of
  a cycle wide. Measured over 2000 tiles (about what the widest view holds), the field costs
  **0.084 ms a frame against 0.050** for the zero-mean version before the lean and the skew — 0.2 %
  of a 60 fps budget, and this is the one number here that *is* safe to take from a headless run,
  because it is V8 arithmetic rather than the rasteriser.

On a GTX 1060 at 886×498 over the treeline the whole pass is inside measurement noise of not
running at all — see [What this pass costs](#what-this-pass-costs). Do not profile this in a
software rasteriser: headless Chrome on SwiftShader reports the cloud multiplies as the dominant
cost, and on a real GPU they are nearly free while a texture change the software path does not
care about is worth half the frame.
