# Gameplay systems

The player (momentum, tools, dodge), the entities that share the world, the gold economy, what
you can build, and the supporting subsystems. Read this before changing how an input resolves,
what something pays out, or what a structure does.

Everything below describes **a player**, not *the* player: each mechanic runs per player off
`p.input`, and `player` is only the local player. [multiplayer.md](multiplayer.md) covers the player
model, the input struct, teams, bots and how two players' orders are resolved.

> Several numbers below (ice cap, steer, slide threshold and fatigue, draw time and speed, arrow
> damage, dash speed, max hp) are **per class** — the constants are baselines the kits are
> written against and the sim reads them through `kitOf(p)`. See [Classes](multiplayer.md#classes).

## Momentum movement (players only)

A player moves on a real velocity (`p.vx/vy`): `p.input.mx/my` accelerates, and the surface
underfoot sets friction and speed caps. All the tuning constants live in the `players` banner of
[js/player.js](../../js/player.js) (`ICE_MAX`, `SLIDE_MIN`/`SLIDE_EXIT`, `TRAIL_MIN`, above
`CLASSES`, whose kits are written against them) and the per-surface rates inline in
`updatePlayer()`'s movement block, which every player runs. **Momentum is deliberately players-only**
— animals, robots, and knockback still use the old direct-move idiom.

- **Snow at walking speed** uses a near-instant vector approach (settles in ~3 frames) tuned to
  feel exactly like the old fixed `PLAYER_SPEED` — crisp starts and stops, nothing floaty.
- **Everything faster** (ice, sliding, or overspeed on snow) switches to a steer-the-heading /
  ease-the-speed model: the travel direction *rotates* toward the input at a per-state rad/s
  rate (carving, never snapping), while speed eases toward a per-state target. Ice pumps
  toward `ICE_MAX` (150, ~2× walk) while a direction is held, glides on idle, and barely
  bleeds overspeed; snow kills overspeed (dodge exits included) in well under a second
  unless you shift-slide to keep it.
- **Dodge roll** is an impulse into the same velocity: `tryDodge()` sets `vx/vy` to
  `max(DODGE_SPEED, current speed)` (a dash never slows you), the roll itself applies no
  friction, and the speed **carries out of the roll** for the surface to spend — so dashes
  chain into real speed on ice but die fast on snow. I-frames still end with the roll. That
  carried speed is also what the roll **hits** for — see [The roll is a hit](#the-roll-is-a-hit).
- **Shift = slide**: engages only above `SLIDE_MIN` (85), drops out below `SLIDE_EXIT` (55) or
  on release (hysteresis). Sliding keeps momentum across snow (low friction, reduced steering).
  Tools work normally while sliding — you can draw, hold, and loose the bow or E a tree
  mid-slide; only the hole-flounder and the dodge roll lock tools out. Snow slides have **fatigue** (`player.slideT`): friction ramps
  with slide duration, so the early glide is cheap but the tail drops off hard and a slide
  ends decisively (~2.2 s from full speed). The timer recovers while sliding on ice, so
  snow→ice→snow chains start each snow leg fresh-ish; ice slide friction itself is flat. Above `TRAIL_MIN` (110) it carves a surface-specific double
  trail: on snow, two-tone carved grooves (shadowed top row, lit bottom row — lit from the
  top-left like the rest of the art); on ice, thin frosted skate scratches. Marks are
  `k`-tagged entries pushed into the existing `footprints` decal array (cap 800) every ~2.5px
  of travel, interpolated along the path so a fast frame never gaps the line — never drawn
  into the pre-rendered ground canvas — plus snow-spray particle bursts. Snow grooves have
  their own short hold-then-fade life (`SNOW_TRAIL_LIFE` 3.5 s, fading only over the last
  `SNOW_TRAIL_FADE` 1.4 s), so a trail stays crisp and then wipes away tail-first behind the
  player; ice scratches and walking footprints keep the original 9 s linear fade.
- **Prone** short-circuits all of it: a belly crawl takes the plain direct-approach branch on any
  surface at a flat `PRONE_SPEED`, and sliding is refused outright. See
  [Prone](#prone-under-the-snow).
- **Walls kill the blocked axis** (`blockedX` → `vx = 0`, same for y) in both the roll and
  normal movement, so you never grind along a treeline at full speed. A wall taken **head-on
  mid-roll** costs more than the axis: past `TACKLE_MIN` of speed driven into it, that is a
  [tackle](#the-roll-is-a-hit).
- Walk animation and footprints key off actual speed now (`sp > 8`), not input; sliding and
  ice-gliding use the standing pose. `die(p)` and `Player.reset()` zero `vx/vy` and clear
  `sliding`. Footprints and slide trails from every player share the one `footprints` decal array.

## Unit collisions

Players, animals and robots are solid circles to each other (`PLAYER_R` 4.5, deer 5, wolf and alpha 4.5, the dire wolf 9,
rabbit 2.5, robot 3 — `unitRadius`). **Birds are the exception**: they fly, so `separateUnits()`
skips them entirely and they have no `UNIT_MASS` entry. Tile collision stays per-mover in
`moveEntity`; unit-vs-unit is a separate relaxation pass, `separateUnits()` in the
`movement & collision` banner, that `updatePlay` runs once after every player, animal and robot
has stepped. For each overlapping pair it splits the overlap by inverse mass (`UNIT_MASS`:
player 3, deer 2.2, wolf 2, alpha 2.5, dire wolf 5, robot 0.7, rabbit 0.5; a camp monster's radius and mass are its `MONSTER` row, read through `unitRadius`/`unitMass` — a player shoves a rabbit aside and barely
notices, two players split it evenly). Every
push goes through `moveEntity(…, strict)`, which treats open water as a wall even for players
(a shove never dunks anyone), and **any push a wall refuses is handed to the other unit** — the
player's share is tried first, so a small unit can never pin a player in a corner: the pinner
is the one that gets moved (a rabbit wedged between you and a rock squirts out sideways).
Two passes settle piles; the pass is deterministic (fixed order, no `rng`).

**A live dodge roll is the one exception to any of it.** `separateUnits` skips a pair outright
when one side is a player mid-roll and the other is *small* — every player, every robot, and
every animal but a deer — because the roll goes through them and
[swipes them](#the-roll-is-a-hit) instead of shoving them. A deer keeps its mass and its contact,
which is what makes running into one a tackle rather than a pass.

## Pathfinding

Everything that walks to a goal on its own — robots, bots, hunting wolves and patrolling
ones, prey both fleeing and grazing, any future enemy — routes through the `pathfinding` banner
rather than steering straight at it. Nothing that walks holds a bare heading on a timer any more.
`findPath(sx, sy, gx, gy, reach, budget)` is grid A* over the tile map: a tile is `walkable()`
when it is in-world, not `isSolidTile`, and not open water (ground 2); eight-connected with no
corner cutting (a diagonal needs both orthogonal neighbours open, so a unit of radius ≤ 5 never
clips a tree walking centre to centre); octile heuristic; typed-array scores stamped by a
generation counter so nothing is cleared between searches; a binary heap; no `rng`, so it is
deterministic. `reach` is the Chebyshev distance at which the goal counts as reached — 1 lets a
unit path to a tree it cannot stand on (and is exactly `WORK_REACH` for a bot's swing). A search
that exhausts `NAV_BUDGET` (700 expansions, ~a 25-tile detour) returns the route to the closest
tile it saw with `path.partial = true`, so a far goal still gets a first leg and a later replan
finishes it; only an enclosed goal (or an unwalkable one with reach 0) returns `null`. Measured:
~12 µs per full search, so dozens of units replanning several times a second is noise.

Units do not call `findPath` directly. `navTo(e, gx, gy, r, reach, dt, budget)` (the last optional: a bigger
search budget for a walk into a corner's forest — the bots' `AI_ROOST_BUDGET`, ai.js) keeps a route on
`e.nav` (`{ path, i, gtx, gty, replanT, fail, stallT, … }`, created lazily on any entity) and
returns `{ dx, dy, d, ok }` — the unit direction to move this frame, the straight-line distance
to the goal (callers keep their own arrive radius), and `ok`. A plan first tries
`navLineClear()` (the same four-corner test `moveEntity` makes, every 4 px) and takes a direct
line when it is open, else A* plus `navSmooth()` string-pulling; it replans when the goal moves
more than a tile, every `NAV_REPLAN` (0.6 s), or — through `navStep()` — when `moveEntity`
reports a wall. **`ok = false` is the give-up signal**: the goal is unreachable, or the unit has
made no progress for `NAV_STALL` (1.6 s — pinned by other units, which routes ignore and
`separateUnits` resolves). There are no stuck timers anywhere else; a caller that gets `false`
drops the goal (robots and bots blacklist it for 12 s). A failed goal is not searched again until
`replanT` runs out. `navStep(e, gx, gy, r, spd, dt, reach)` wraps `navTo` with the
`moveEntity` call and `mvx/mvy` for the animal/robot movers; players (bots) take `navTo`'s
direction into `p.input` and move through their momentum. `navClear(e)` forgets a route.
`DBG.showPaths = true` draws every live route (`drawNavPaths`: bots gold, prey green, wolves
red, robots blue), and `DBG.findPath`/`DBG.walkable`/`DBG.navTo` are exposed for staging.

Momentum: on the first pass a unit closing on the contact loses only its *share* of the
velocity component along the normal — tangential speed is untouched, so a slide into a deer
deflects along it and carries on rather than sticking — the rest of that component is handed to
the other unit as knockback (`kbx/kby`, the same channel arrows use), and the lighter side of
a contact gets a 0.3 bounce. Players carry `vx/vy`; animals and robots only carry their
knockback (their walk is a direction re-chosen each tick), and an idle animal/robot now applies
its knockback too, so a shoved deer actually moves. Measured: a 150 px/s slide into a deer
comes out at ~60 px/s with a sideways kick and the deer shoved ~14 px.

## Tools and bits

Everything in this section lives in **[js/tools.js](../../js/tools.js)**, under the `tools & bits`
banner. It loads after `actions.js` because a shot it fires is the arrow pipeline's, and its
top-level code registers one `ITEMS` row per kind — which is what makes the bag, the drop pickup,
the death spill and the refusal flash work on tools and bits with no storage code of their own.

**There is ONE weapon slot** (`p.tools`, `TOOL_SLOTS` = 1 — the array and the drag plumbing stay
generic over it), and the left button fires it. Keys 1-4 belong to the
[class abilities](#class-abilities-keys-1-4) now. The slot holds a **tool**; a tool holds
**bits**; the bits are what actually fly. Both are found in the world, never bought, and both are
carried items you can drag around — so the weapon is a thing a player assembles rather than a
thing they are issued.

### A tool

One entry in the `TOOLS` table (`shortbow`, `sling`, `recurve`, `hornbow`, `longbow`). A tool is a
**body** and carries no behaviour of its own — three numbers and a look:

| field | means |
| --- | --- |
| `rof` | game steps between shots. `toolRof(p, cell)` turns it into seconds and scales it by `kit.nock / BOW_NOCK`, so QUICKDRAW, the LOOSE ability rank and QUICK HANDS all still quicken it |
| `cap` | how many bit cells it has (2–5) |
| `tensile` | **the weight budget one press has to spend on those cells** — reset at the top of every activation and spent bottom-up, and the first cell that would push the running total past it ends the press there ([firing](#firing)) |
| `tier` / `art` | which of the three `TOOL_TIERS` palettes it wears, and which 12×12 silhouette |

`cap` and `tensile` are the two halves of a tool: **cap is how much you may hang on it, tensile
how much of that it can swing at once.** The tiers grow the two together at roughly four weight a
cell — SHORTBOW 9/2, SLING 7/2, RECURVE 13/3, HORN BOW 15/4, LONGBOW 22/5 — so a build that fits
its cap and busts its budget is not refused, it is *truncated*, and the weapon well wears a
[**"!"**](rendering.md#the-bit-column) to say so.

A tool is **instanced**: its bag cell *is* the tool, `bits` array and all (`makeTool`), so it is
moved between bag, slot and drop rather than rebuilt from its type name — see the hard rule in
[CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md#hard-rules). That is what makes "throw a loaded tool away and pick it
up later" work with no code: `spawnDrop`'s `it` payload is the same object the bag had, and
`bagPut` puts that same object back.

### A bit

One entry in the `BITS` table, and there are two kinds of them, told apart by `proj`.

**Every bit has a `weight`**, projectile and modifier alike, because weight is what a press
*spends* out of the tool's tensile budget. A heavy bit is not dead weight any more — it is
expensive, and what it costs is whatever is stacked after it.

A **projectile bit** is one shot: `path` (how it flies), `solid` (whether a wall stops it), `ff`
(whether it will hurt your own side), `kb`
([knockback](#knockback-one-number-thrown-at-three-weights)), and
`life`/`speed`/`dmg` as baselines. Optional `lit` is a light radius it carries in
flight; optional `reach` widens every hit test past the tip (a bit with a *body* — the fist, the
axe); optional `body` names the silhouette the shots pass draws it as (`BIT_BODY`, js/render.js);
optional `impact` names what it does where it *lands* (`BIT_IMPACT`, js/tools.js); and
`bot: false` marks a kind no bot will load. A spent shot is simply gone — nothing lands to be
picked back up.

#### Knockback: one number thrown at three weights

`kb` is a **multiplier**, not a speed, and 1 is the ordinary shove. It has to be, because the
three kinds of unit are already pushed at three different weights — a player at `HIT_KB` (110 px/s,
js/player.js), a worker at `ROBOT_KB` (40, js/robots.js), an animal on a curve off the draw
(25–70) — and one number written on a bit has to mean the same thing thrown at any of them. It
rides to `hurtUnit` as `o.kbMul`, which scales whatever shove that kind takes; `o.kb` beside it
is still the absolute px/s an *ability* picks for a particular blow. A shot with no `kb` at all
pushes exactly as hard as it always did, which is what kept turret bolts untouched.

The spread across the table is the point of the number: a WISP barely nudges (×0.3), an ARROW is
the baseline (×1), an ICE LANCE staggers (×1.6), a THROWING LOG flattens (×2.4) and a BIG FIST
throws a body across the snow (×4). The tooltip prints it as `x4`, the one bit row that is a
multiple rather than a quantity.

A **modifier bit** (`proj: false`) never flies, but it costs weight like anything else. Its
`mod(m)` edits the shot envelope — `spdMul`, `dmgMul`, `dmgAdd`, `lifeMul`, `fan` (one shot
becomes N in a spread), `dup` (the whole fan fired again), `lit`, and the fire quartet below.

Two rules govern it, and both are load-bearing:

- **It applies forward and only forward.** A modifier changes every projectile *after* it in the
  list and none before it, so where a modifier sits is the whole of what it is worth and a FLAME
  in the LAST cell sets nothing alight. Once a press has reached one it stays in the envelope for
  the rest of that press — there is no per-shot expiry. That is why the WARRIOR flies in with its
  HEFT *before* its arrow. The shelf draws that reach as a **rail** running forward off the
  fitting ([the shelf](#the-weapon-shelf)).
- **It compounds with whatever is already there.** Every `mod` composes with the value it is
  handed — `*=` a multiplier, `+=` a quantity — and must never `=` or `Math.max` it. Two SPEEDUPs are
  four times the speed, two SPLITTERs nine shots, two FLAMEs twice as long at twice the rate
  (which is exactly a PYRE). **Every modifier added from here follows that rule**; the only field
  that is set rather than composed is `m.type`, because a damage type is a category and not a
  magnitude. `toolPlan` walking forward rather than folding a set is what makes it possible.

Eight exist: SPEEDUP, SPLITTER, DUPLICATE, HEFT, LONGSHOT, and the three that carry fire.

#### Fire on a shot

`m.type` is the shot's **damage type** (`DMG_TYPES`, js/actions.js — `blunt` unless a modifier says
otherwise), and `m.burn` / `m.burnDps` are the fire it leaves in the body it hits. The shot carries
all four onto the arrow, and every hit branch in the arrow loop hands them to `hurtUnit` — so a
flaming shot burns a rival, a deer, a bird and a worker bot identically, with no per-kind code.
What a burn then does is [status effects](#status-effects-one-set-for-every-unit).

| bit | tier | what it writes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **FLAME** | KEEN, under SPEEDUP | `type: 'fire'`, `BURN_T` 3 s at `BURN_DPS` 6, `dmgAdd += 2`, `lit` 30. The flat bonus is small on purpose: the burn is where the damage went |
| **PYRE** | GILDED, under FLAME | the same fire, `PYRE_T` 6 s at `PYRE_DPS` 12 — twice as long and twice as hot |
| **CINDER BURST** | GILDED, under DUPLICATE | plain fire, plus `m.cinder` — a `CINDER_R` (26 px) ring lit where the shot **ends**, hit or miss. The multiplying lineage's finish: SPLITTER multiplies one bit's arms, DUPLICATE fires the fan again, CINDER multiplies the impact |

A tool holding only modifiers fires nothing, the same as one whose very first cell is already
heavier than the body can swing.

#### The closing line: three bits that are not archery

BIG FIST → BIG AXE → TELEPORT REQUEST is a lineage about *arriving* rather than about shooting,
and all three are deliberately hostile to range.

| bit | tier | what it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **BIG FIST** | WORN | a punch: `FIST_T` (0.2 s) of flight at 300 px/s — about a body length — 16 damage and `kb` ×4. The short life is the whole trick: it is gone before it reads as a projectile, so the left button looks like a melee swing. `reach` 5 gives it a body rather than a tip |
| **BIG AXE** | KEEN | the same brief flight on the `curve` path, 20 damage, `kb` ×2, `reach` 6 — and `impact: 'chop'`, which is what makes it more than a heavy fist |
| **TELEPORT REQUEST** | GILDED | 620 px/s and 6 damage, a body that is not a shape at all, and `impact: 'warp'` |

All three carry `bot: false`: a bot has no pointer and cannot read a weapon whose point is
*where you end up standing*, the same refusal that already keeps boomerangs and orbits out of
its hands.

**What a bit does where it lands** is one row in `BIT_IMPACT` (js/tools.js), called from the arrow
update only when the shot ended **on** something (`a.struck` — a wall, a tree, a body, the roost,
a dummy, a target face) rather than merely running out of life over open snow. That distinction
is the teleport's whole rule: a request that hits nothing takes you nowhere.

- **`warp`** — the shooter is standing where the shot stopped, rewound `WARP_BACK` (0.02 s) of
  flight so it lands *short* of what it hit. The spot is pulled onto a tile a body can stand on
  (`nearestDryTile`), so a request buried in a treeline puts you beside the tree rather than
  inside it; the jump rises you out of the snow and drops the fish hoist, the way any hit does.
  The tell is `warps` — the character stamped as a flat violet silhouette every `WARP_STEP` (11
  px) of the line crossed, up to `WARP_MAX` (14) of them, fading together over `WARP_FLASH_T`
  (0.34 s) and **never at the arrival**, because the body is already standing there
  (`drawWarps`, js/render.js; aged in `updateFx`). Without the trail a teleport reads as a body
  blinking out of existence rather than as a path.
- **`chop`** — one chop into every tree within `AXE_CHOP_R` (26 px) of where the head stopped,
  the struck tile included. It is the same blow an E swing lands (`chopTree`, js/actions.js —
  gold, stump, fell payout, loot roll and the rare pine's jackpot), routed through `contest()`
  on the same `work:` key, so an axe and a swing on one tile in one step are one chop. Three
  throws fell a pine, and they fell its neighbours with it.

### Firing

**One press is the whole tool, resolved in one frame.** Nothing cycles between presses: a press
spends the tensile budget up the column and everything it can afford leaves together, so a tool
whose budget covers all of it fires all of it at once.

`fireTool(p)` is the one entry point — the falling edge of `input.fire`, for every player alike:

1. Read the cover first (`ambushReady`), before anything below can break it.
2. No tool on the selected slot → `dryFire(p)` and stop. (A fish underfoot no longer takes the
   press: the catch is automatic — `autoFish`, [the swing tools](#the-swing-tools-e) — and a press
   on the ice flies like any other.)
3. `toolPlan(cell)` — the one function the whole weapon runs on, below.
4. No shots in the plan → `dryFire`. Otherwise `emitBit` for each, then `p.nockT = toolRof(...)`,
   one `SFX.arrow`, and `risePlayer` (the shot is what breaks cover).

#### `toolPlan`: one activation, in one pass

`toolPlan(cell)` walks the cells from 0 up and returns `{ shots, used, cut, load, tensile }`. It is
the *only* place the arithmetic lives, and the press, the [aim line](#the-draw) and the
[shelf](rendering.md#the-weapon-shelf) all read it — so the three can never disagree about what
the button is about to do.

- An empty cell costs nothing and stops nothing.
- Otherwise the cell's weight is added to `load` (the whole row's weight, which is what the
  "!" reads) and, while the press is still running, tested against the budget: if
  `used + weight > tensile` the walk records `cut` and fires nothing further. Everything before
  the cut has already gone.
- A projectile inside the budget is pushed onto `shots` **with a snapshot of the envelope as it
  stands right now**; a modifier inside the budget folds into the envelope for everything after.

`peekBit(cell)` is `shots[0].i` — the lead shot, which is what the column's caret marks and what
the aim line is drawn for. `toolLoad(cell)` and `toolOver(cell)` are the column's weight and
whether it exceeds the budget.

`emitBit` is where the player is folded back in: the bit's own damage leads, the class kit's
`dmgBase`/`dmgPow`, the kit's speed bonus (`spdDmg`) and the hero level add to it, **the draw
scales the whole sum** (`drawDmgMul`, [The draw](#the-draw)) and then the modifiers scale that —
so gear, cards and levels all still matter to a weapon they know nothing about, and a spammed
level-twelve bow is still a weak one. Speed and life come from `shotFlight(b, m, pw)`, the same
envelope the aim line measures. The shot goes into the same `arrows` array as before, carrying
`path`, `solid`, `ff`, `kb`, `reach`, `body`, `impact`, `type`, `burn`, `burnDps`, `cinder`,
`lit` and `col` alongside the old fields.

`toolReady(p)` is the only refusal besides the cycle: an empty slot, and a tool whose budget
reaches no projectile at all (nothing loaded, only modifiers, or a first cell already too heavy
for the body), are both dry, and `updatePlayer` refuses the draw on both the same way
(`dryFire`, the slack-string tell).

Every bit a press can afford leaves in the **same frame**, so no two of them may be stacked inside
one another: each bit past the first is nudged `SHOT_SKEW` (0.05 rad) off the aim, alternating
sides, and a DUPLICATE's repeats `DUP_SKEW` (0.07) — per *bit* and per *repeat*, never per arm of
a SPLITTER's fan, which already spreads its own arms.

### Flight paths

`steerBit(a, dt)` runs once per shot per sim step **before** the step is integrated, so the path
owns the velocity and the trail, the hit tests and the drawn body just follow it. A turret bolt
carries no `path` and falls straight through.

| `path` | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `line` | nothing — the old arrow, and it costs nothing |
| `zig` | the bearing weaves ±`ZIG_SWING` at `ZIG_HZ` |
| `lob` | drag on both axes plus `LOB_FALL` gravity: a heavy throw that arcs down and lands |
| `boomer` | out on the bearing slowing to nothing, then hauled back to whoever threw it; the flight ends when it gets home |
| `orbit` | a ring of `ORBIT_R` around the shooter, eased out over the first 0.25 s and swept at its own speed |
| `curve` | the bearing sweeps one way at `CURVE_TURN` (3.4 rad/s): a scythe, the way a thrown axe goes |

Three per-bit rules land in the arrow update in `updatePlay`: `a.solid !== false` gates the tile
test (that is the whole of "never hits ground"), `a.ff` lifts the team check on players and worker
bots (never on the shooter, at any weight), and `a.cinder` lights a ring around wherever the shot
ended. A burning shot trails fire instead of team colour and bursts embers where it lands.

**Three hit tests, one blow.** The branches differ only in what they test against — a raised tower
shield and a 7 px body for a player, `robotHit` for a chassis, `animalHit` for a body that may be up
on its own altitude — and all three then call the same local `blow()`, which hands the bit's damage,
type, fire and shove to `hurtUnit`. Nothing about *what a shot does* is written per kind, which is
what keeps the left button honest across the whole roster.

### The weapon shelf

**The build is on screen at all times, on the backpack's top edge** — the tool at the left end of
a row and its bit cells running right in **firing order**, which is also the direction a fitting
reaches along, so the row reads the way the press resolves. Until **PATCH 3.21** it was a column
that rose out of the strip's weapon well on hover, and a build you had to hold the pointer still
to look at was a build nobody looked at; it moved to the one corner already about carried things,
a cell away from the pack it is loaded out of.

It is **not a panel**: bare wells with their own drop shadows, so the corner stays world
everywhere between them and only a cell itself swallows a click. It is pinned by its BOTTOM to
the pack (the open frame's top edge, or the shut button's) and grows upward, and the row's RIGHT
end is flush with the pack's grid — a bigger tool grows leftward rather than moving the corner it
is read in. The geometry is `shelfCellRect(i)` (cell **-1 is the tool**), the pointer
`shelfHit` (`{kind:'tool'}` / `{kind:'bit', i}` / null), and the draw `drawShelf` — all in
js/ui.js, at 1x with the backpack it stands on rather than at the strip's HUD SIZE.

Five marks and no words, [drawn](rendering.md#the-weapon-shelf) rather than labelled: the ROW is
the press left to right; a cell **past the cut** is red-rimmed and washed out; **weight** is pips
along a cell's bottom edge; a **rail** over the row runs from each fitting to the last shot it
reaches, blipping over every shot it is really in the envelope of; and the **gold bar** in the gap
left of a cell is the lead shot. And one event: every cell the last press SPENT flashes white and
fades (`bitLit`/`bitLitAt`, js/tools.js — `BIT_LIT_T` 0.3 s, aged in `updateFx`), its rails with
it, so the left button teaches the row it is firing.

The drag is one mechanism shared by the grid, the weapon slot and the shelf
([UI banner](../../js/ui.js), `state.drag`): a press **arms** a pick-up and only travel past
`DRAG_SLOP` promotes it, so a tap on a berry still eats it
while a drag off either one picks it up. A release over any well that will take it puts it there;
over the rest of the HUD it goes home; **over the world it is thrown**, which is the only way to
get rid of a tool — and it goes with its bits.

**A drop onto a loaded well SWAPS.** Whatever the drop displaces goes back to *home* — the well
this drag started from (`dragHome`) — because home is the one place already known to be free: it
is where the thing in hand came out of. So a bit dragged from the pack onto a loaded bit cell
trades places with the bit that was there, a tool dropped on the weapon well sends the old one to
the bag cell it came out of, and a bit dragged out of the column onto a bit in the grid does the
same in reverse: one move each way, which is the swap `sendBagCell`'s CLICK already made and the
drag did not. Home can be gone by the time it is asked — a stack that did not empty is still
sitting in it, an earlier swap in the same gesture filled it, or it cannot hold that kind at all
(a berry does not go in a bit cell, a bit does not go on the weapon key) — and then the displaced
item rides the cursor exactly as it used to, which is free, because what was on it is what just
went into the well.

**A plain click is the whole move**, because every one of these wells has exactly one sensible
destination (`sendBagCell` / `sendBitCell` / `sendSlot`): a **bit** in the grid loads into the
weapon's first free cell, a **bit** in the column comes back to the pack (merging its own stack,
`bagAdd`), a **tool** in the grid trades places with the weapon in hand, and the **weapon well**
stows what it holds in the pack the way a bit does. That completes the grammar the backpack
already had — clicking a cell *uses* what is in it, a berry by eating it and a card by drawing
from it — for the two kinds that had no use and could only deny.

It is resolved on the **release** (`hudRelease`), never on the press, which is what keeps the
drag: a press that travels past `DRAG_SLOP` is still a pick-up and arranging the pack by hand is
untouched. Each helper returns whether it *handled* the click, so a berry, a card and an empty
cell fall through to the click they always were. Nothing can be destroyed: when the destination
has no room the item does not move at all, and the container that is full is the one that
refuses — the pack through `bagDenied()`, the weapon through its twin `toolDenied()`, which bands
the weapon well in the same red for the same 0.6 s. The hover tooltip names what the click will
do where the item actually sits (`tipSend`), which is why a tool reads TAKE IT IN HAND in the
grid and STOW IT IN THE PACK in the well.

**Shift SENDS**, in both hands. With an **empty** one it is the plain click's own transfer above,
nothing more: shift-click is what anybody trained on another inventory reaches for first, so the
modifier finds the gesture instead of denying it. With something already riding the cursor, a
plain press puts the item down where it lands, while a press begun with shift held is remembered
on `state.dragPend` (`keep`) and its release runs `sendAt(mx, my)` instead — the same wells
`dragDrop` tries, in the same order, but acting on what is already *sitting* there and leaving
what is in hand in hand. Over anything else — the bare frame, an empty cell, the rest of the HUD —
it does nothing at all, because that promise is the whole point. Recording the modifier at the
press rather than reading it at the release is deliberate: letting go of shift mid-click cannot
change what the gesture turns out to be.

The pack advertises the gesture rather than expecting you to know it: `drawShiftHint` floats a
**SHIFT key cap** (the world prompts' own `drawKeyPrompt`, the keybind-indicator carve-out of
[CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)'s UI rule) over the pack's top-right corner whenever the pointer is
on a well with somewhere to send what it holds, and the verb on it is that **destination** —
`LOAD` for a bit in the grid, `STOW` for a bit on the shelf or the tool on the weapon,
`HOLD` for a tool in the grid — so the plate teaches which way the transfer goes rather than
merely announcing a key. `shiftVerb` asks the same wells in the same order `sendAt` does, so the
plate and the click can never disagree; a berry and a card get none, because eating and drafting
are not transfers. The cap presses down while the key is actually held.

### Where tools and bits come from

`dropLoot(x, y, tier, chance)` rolls one find on the shared `rng` at the moment a swing lands
(never inside `genWorld` — see the seed rule). `LOOT_TOOL` (0.3) of any find is a tool, the rest a
bit, and only kinds at or under the given tier are in the pool.

| source | chance | tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a broken rock | `ROCK_DROP` 0.2 | 0 |
| a felled tree | `TREE_DROP` 0.04 | 0 |
| a sprung chest | `CHEST_TOOL` 0.75 | up to 2 |

**A found bit arms itself.** The pack is the overflow, not the destination: a bit walked over
(or bought over the counter) goes into the tool's first free cell, and only what the tool cannot
hold lands in the grid — `fitAdd(p, type, n)`, with `fitRoom(p, type)` the room it counts, which
is why a FULL pack with an empty bit cell still magnetises a drop and still claims it. The drop
pickup (js/sim.js) and `shopBuy` (js/shop.js) both go through the pair, so the ordinary way to
arm a find is to walk over it, and the drag is what you reach for to ARRANGE a build rather than
what you must do to have one — which is half of why the [shelf](#the-weapon-shelf) is on screen
at all times: a bit that loaded itself has to be seen loading itself. It fills a free cell
whatever the tensile budget says (a bit the press cannot afford is drawn red on the shelf and
sent back to the pack with one click, so the pickup never has to guess what you meant by it),
and a **bot is left out** — `botFitLoadout` does this for them on its own timer and is choosier
about it, so a pickup that shoved a bit into a bot's tool would only make it a worse shot.

So the bottom tier lies around loose and the good stuff is in the treeline's chests. A found tool
comes out **empty** — its bits are the next thing to find.

The pool a roll draws from is the **whole table** at or under that tier: every kind is unlocked for
every profile alike, so any match can roll any of them. See [the wiki](#the-wiki).

### Tiers, and how a find reads

`TOOL_TIERS` is a colour and nothing else in the sim: what a tier buys you is written into each
tool's own numbers. The tier is stated in **one** place and the same way everywhere — the plate
behind the icon, in every well the item ever sits in (bag cell, weapon slot, bit cell, drag ghost,
loadout card) — which is why nothing on screen has to say "TIER 2". `tierPlate(type)` is that
lookup and `itemTier(type)` the raw index. The top tier is the only one that moves: `tierShine`
sweeps a highlight across its plate.

**Which of the two kinds of bit it is is stated on that same plate**, by `modPlate` (ui.js),
called wherever a bit sits — the grid, the column, the cursor, the counter's wells, a tech node,
the tooltip's own icon plate. A **projectile** keeps the flat square plate every carried item
wears: it is a thing you fire. A **modifier** gets its plate hatched in the bit's own colour and
its corners cut back — it never flies, it is fitted *into* the tool — so the two are told apart
across a whole grid without recognising a single glyph. Colour is already spent on tier, which is
why the difference has to be texture and silhouette. The column then adds what only it knows: a
projectile's `weight` as gold pips along the cell's bottom (red when this tool cannot throw it), a
modifier's colour as a bar, because it has no weight at all. On the ground a find glints in its tier's colour so it is
told from a berry at a distance. A tool's **shape** says which family it is and its **palette**
says its tier, so three 12×12 silhouettes cover five tools across three tiers — the same trick
`GEAR_MATS` plays with one gear icon across four materials.

### Bots

A bot has no shelf and no pointer, so `botFitLoadout(p)` (called from `updateAI`'s step 8 on
a 2.5 s timer) does by hand what a person does with a drag: push loose bits into the tool it is
firing **while they still fit inside its tensile budget**, sort the build so its modifiers sit
before the shots they are meant to change (a stable sort, no rng), and put a spare tool on a free
key — or over a strictly worse body, which then takes the bag cell the new one came out of. It
only takes bits that fly *toward* what they were aimed at; a bot cannot read a boomerang or an
orbit and leaves those for someone who can.

### Starting loadouts

`CLASS_LOADOUT` gives each class a tool and its bits, and `giveLoadout(p)` is called from
`Player.reset()` and from `setClass()` — so the weapon is part of picking a class, every AI
player gets its own, and a respawn is re-armed. The HUNTER flies in with a SHORTBOW loaded ARROW +
BARBED SHOT (7 of its 9 strength, both firing); the WARRIOR with a SLING loaded **HEFT then
ARROW** — the fitting before the shot, filling the sling's 7 exactly. The order in `bits` is the
firing order, and a starting kit that fitted a modifier *above* its only shot would teach the
forward-only rule backwards on the first press of the match. Death **spills the equipped tool** with
the bag (`spillInventory`), so a build lies where its owner fell and the bird hands back the
starting one — you come back armed, but not as the player you were. The gear pop-up's preview
shows the weapon at the body's side (`drawGearPreview`, js/menu.js) — the other half of what a
class flies out with.

## Class abilities (keys 1-4)

Everything in this section lives in **[js/abilities.js](../../js/abilities.js)**, under the
`class abilities` banner. Keys 1-4 cast the four actives of the player's
[class](multiplayer.md#classes) — `CLASS_AB[p.cls]`, one row per key, where **what an ability IS
lives in its table entry** (`cd`, `cast`, `use(p)`), never in an `if` elsewhere. The press goes
through `input.ability` (edge-triggered, like the dodge) into `tryAbility(p, i)`, so a bot casts
through exactly the key a human presses; `updateAbilities(p, dt)` runs the cooldowns, lands the
cast, and ages every state an ability leaves on a body; `updateAbilityWorld(dt)` (called from
`updatePlay`) steps what they leave in the world.

**Abilities are bought with skill points, never gold — and a key you have not bought does
nothing.** Each key starts **LOCKED at level 0**: the class hands you the four actives, not the
use of them. Every level costs **one skill point** — the only thing a point buys, one per
[hero level](multiplayer.md#hero-levels). The **first** point on a key unlocks it (`abUnlocked(p,
i)`, the one gate: `tryAbility` refuses a level-0 key outright and every bot reaches for keys
through `abReady(p, i)` = bought and off cooldown), and each one after shaves `AB_LV_CD` (12%)
off that ability's cooldown — the one lever that means something on all eight keys, twice at most,
so a capped key comes back 24% faster than a freshly unlocked one. Four keys × `AB_LV_MAX` is
**12 points against the 12 a capped hero earns**, so the ladder ends exactly where the hero does:
every point has a home and nothing is stranded. The choice is the ORDER — you land with one point
and four dark keys, so the first thing a match asks is which ability you want to be, and a key
taken to 3 early is three keys still dark at level 4.
The rest of the set: `abLvCanBuy(p, i)` (a point in hand, room on the key),
`buyAbilityLv(p, i)` (the single entry point, reached through `input.cmd {kind:'ability', i}` →
`runCmd` by HUD plate click and bots alike — the unlock floats `NAME UNLOCKED` and a fatter
burst, every level after floats the number), and `abCdOf(p, i)` — which every cooldown-setting
site reads instead of the table's base `cd` (the cast landing, and the shield's comes-down
reset). `p.abLv` resets with the match like `p.gearLv`. The wells carry the progress — fat
gear-style buy pips along the top edge, **one seat per point the key can hold**, so an empty row
is a locked ability — and a locked well stands dim (dark rim, the icon at `LOCK_DIM`, a grey key
digit), exactly as a meal button with nothing behind it does; a press on one reddens and shakes
it (`abDenied`, the twin of `toolDenied`/`foodDenied`). The ASK floats clear of the wells: while a
point is unspent each un-maxed key grows a bobbing gold plus plate in the open screen above its
well (`abBuyRect`/`abBuyHit`/`drawAbBuyPlate`, UI › `hud strip`), gear's old chevron made a real
button. The plate press buys, any press on the well casts, so the two can never steal each
other's click; hover lights the plate and the tooltip carries the numbers (`LOCKED` and `UNLOCK
1 SKILL PT` on a dark key). Bots spend each free point in `updateAI`'s rung 0, lowest ability
level first — which spends their first four unlocking all four keys before any gets a cut. The cd
column in the tables below is the level-1 base.

**Every ability lands on every kind of body.** A player, a rabbit, a deer, a bird, a wolf and a worker
bot out of the [bot bay](#robots) take the same damage and the same states from all eight — the
tables below say "rival" because that is who you are usually casting at, not because anything else
is exempt. That is not written into each ability: they sweep `unitsNear`/`unitsHit` and land through
`hurtUnit` and the state setters ([status effects](#status-effects-one-set-for-every-unit)), so the
next kind of neutral fauna pushed into `animals` is in range of all eight on the day it is added,
with no edit here. A **structure** is not a unit and takes none of it; the roosting eagle is an
objective with its own damage path, and takes none of it either.

**A cast is a performance**: `p.castT` runs the ability's `cast` seconds, the body visibly does
it (`abilityPose` shifts/tilts the sprite — the pierce's locked lean-back, a hop into the stomp,
the recoil hop off the net shot), movement halves (the pierce windup all but plants the feet —
`PIERCE_SLOW`), and the effect fires at the aim held at the END
of the cast. Casting breaks prone cover like a shot, is refused mid-roll / mid-stun / in a hole,
and a stun knocks a cast (and the shield, the rush, and the grapple's rope) out of the hands.
Everything an ability
does to a body is **drawn on that body for both sides** (`drawAbilityOnPlayer`) — readability
first: the pierce telegraph is drawn for everyone the whole windup, a netted player wears the
net.

HUNTER — bow, distance control, the ground between:

| key | name | cd | what it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **PIERCING SHOT** | 12 s | locks a full draw for `PIERCE_WIND` (0.7 s) — the body plants (`PIERCE_SLOW` ×0.15 walk), the pose leans back and holds, and a thin dashed **telegraph line** is drawn on the ground along the live aim for BOTH sides, gold-flaring as the loose nears. Then the shot fires itself: one enhanced arrow (a full-draw plain arrow ×`PIERCE_MUL` 1.5, `PIERCE_SPD` 380, `PIERCE_RANGE` 260) that **goes through every body on the line** (`a.pierce`/`a.pierceHit`, the arrow loop in js/sim.js) — only a raised shield or the world stops it. The loose is the unmissable cue: `SFX.nock` snap + a white flash on the arrowhead |
| 2 | **NET SHOT** | 15 s | a weighted net down a line (`nets`): first rival hit takes 4 and is **slowed** (`p.slowT`/`slowMul` ×0.4, 2 s, the drape drawn on them); the recoil kicks the hunter backward with an animated hop (`p.hopT`) |
| 3 | **GRAPPLE** | 8 s | throws a hook down the aim ray: the first **tree, dead tree or rock** within `GRAP_RANGE` (170 px) and `GRAP_ASSIST` of the line (the aim assist) anchors it, and the body is reeled straight at it at `GRAP_REEL` (260 px/s — over `SLIDE_MIN`, so shift on release carves a slide). The reel runs **while key 3 is held** (`input.grapple`, the one held ability input); releasing, arriving, a wall or a stun lets go through `grapEnd`, which KEEPS the momentum and starts the cooldown — a long ride and an instant release cost the same. A hook that catches nothing costs `GRAP_MISS_CD` (1 s) |
| 4 | **SNOW COVER** | 60 s | the burrow, moved onto the kit ([Prone](#prone-under-the-snow) is hunter-only now): the cast kneels and calls `tryProne`, the 60 s clock is paid **on the way under**, and the key again — like every other way back up — rises free. A kneel the snow refuses (still moving, sliding, no snow underfoot) refunds the clock. The well's active tell drains with `p.hide` as the cover builds |

WARRIOR — close pressure, blocking, momentum:

| key | name | cd | what it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **SHIELD WALL** | 9 s | raises a tower shield toward the aim for up to 2.2 s (the key again lowers it early; the cooldown starts when it comes DOWN). Any shot flying into the front arc dies on it (`abShieldBlocks`, checked in the arrow loop before the body); walking drops to 40 % and the bow is out of hand |
| 2 | **BULL RUSH** | 12 s | charges the aim line at 300 px/s for 0.42 s (its own movement branch in `updatePlayer`, no i-frames): the **first rival hit is carried** on the shoulder and **slammed** at the end — 10 damage + 0.6 s stun, ×1.6 driven into a wall (`rushStep`/`rushEnd`) |
| 3 | **AVALANCHE STOMP** | 14 s | a leap-stomp at the feet: 12 damage + radial knockback + a beat of stun in `STOMP_R`, and the **crater** (`craters`) is deep snow that slows rivals crossing it for 4 s |
| 4 | **JUGGERNAUT** | 20 s | 5 s: immune to stun (`stunUnit` head) and knockback (`damagePlayer`), speed ramps +50 % over the duration, and body contact at speed bowls rivals over — damage scales with the speed carried in, once per rival per activation (`p.jugHit`) |

A player's movement caps fold through one function — `abilityMoveMul(p)`: root pins, cast/shield/net/
crater drag (the pierce windup's own harder drag included), juggernaut ramps — applied to the walk
cap **and** the ice cap in `updatePlayer`; the grapple's reel is its own movement branch there,
beside the rush's. An
animal or a bot folds the same root and slow through `unitMoveMul(e)`, spent inside `navStep`.
All damage passes its `src`, so an ability kill credits like an arrow — a net whose
caster has since gone down credits nobody (`abCredit`) rather than a corpse. Bots spend abilities in
`updateAI`'s fight rung, off cooldown at ranges each is good at (the grapple is the one they skip —
a held key and a terrain read the ladder does not try to fake). The strip's ability wells (icons,
cooldown wipes) are the HUD's half and live with it in [rendering.md](rendering.md).

## The wiki

The main menu's **WIKI** plank (`m.screen = 'wiki'`, its own `wikiT` ease, ESC back) opens the
game written down: one surface, a tab bar of **pages**, each a scrolling column of blocks.
WHISPERING WOODS (`TRACKS.wiki`) loops under it from the moment it opens — an ordinary
`music.play` the way class select takes the layer, not the counter's hold, because the wiki is
a surface you sit in rather than a window over a running match; `leaveWiki()` puts `intro` back
([Audio](#audio)). The
page itself — the slab, the tabs, the blocks, the rail — is in
[rendering.md](rendering.md#the-wiki-screen); this section is what the pages *say* and where
the numbers come from. Every number on a page is read off the constant the sim spends, never
typed twice, so a retune can never leave the wiki lying.

- **CLASSES** (the page the wiki opens on) — the two classes as class select reads them: the
  body at 3x in the side you play in, the name and role, the three lines of the pitch, and a
  ledger of health and the four stat pips (`CLASSES[c].stats`, `kit.maxHp`); under each, its
  four abilities in key order — the key on a plate, the strip's own 32 px icon in a well
  (`classAbIcon`), the name, COOLDOWN and CAST in the columns (`WIKI_AB_COLS`, off `CLASS_AB`)
  and the blurb wrapped beneath. A hover raises class select's ability card (`tipClassAb` with
  the class passed, so the base cooldown). The intro names what a skill point does
  (`AB_LV_CD`, `AB_LV_MAX`, [Hero levels](multiplayer.md#hero-levels)).
- **BEASTS** — the meadow's two kinds and the camps' three, each drawn wearing the frame it wears in the snow; a
  legend naming the frame's parts once (the level plate, health, the stamina bar that is a
  camp monster's leash bar, the `!` noticed mark); and per kind a line of what it does and a growth
  table — HEALTH and KILL GOLD at levels 1, 6 and 12 (`WIKI_LEVELS`) — from `ANIMAL_HP` /
  `ANIMAL_LV_HP` and `YIELD` / `ANIMAL_LV_GOLD` through the same arithmetic `makeAnimal` and
  `animalDies` use ([Wildlife](#wildlife)). The frames on the page wear the level a spawn would
  be dealt right now (`animalLevel()`).
- **ARSENAL** — every tool and bit, and **every one is unlocked**: the page is not a shop, not a
  skill tree and not a gate but the picture of what the map may hand you, and it may hand you
  all of it — a profile on its first flight rolls exactly what one five hundred matches old
  rolls (**PATCH 2.08**; before it, kinds were researched with lifetime gold and a fresh profile
  played out of a much smaller pool). Three tables — TOOLS (rate of fire, bit slots, tensile),
  BITS (damage, weight, speed, lifespan, flight) and MODIFIERS (weight, and the first sentence
  of the blurb) — worn to gilded, each kind's icon on its own tier plate with the blue pip for "you
  have held one" (`PROFILE.techSeen`), and a hover raising the full card in the tooltip
  (`tipKind`, ui.js). Until PATCH 2.90 this plank was a **TECH TREE**: the same kinds as an 8×3
  grid of lineages, nothing written down but the tier names, every number read one hover at a
  time. The table replaced it because a page for learning is a page for reading numbers.

The `TECH` table in [js/tools.js](../../js/tools.js) still carries the kinds and exactly one
edge per node — `req`, the node beneath it, null on the tier-0 row. Nothing at runtime reads the
edge: it is the arsenal's lineage on paper (each root plus at most two children — SHORTBOW →
RECURVE BOW → LONGBOW, ARROW → CARE ARROW → ICE LANCE, BARBED SHOT → THROWING LOG → HEFT, and so
on), the ARSENAL page lists kinds in its order, and a future page may want to draw it.

**`LOOT_POOL` is every kind at or under a tier**, split into tools and bits, and it is built once
by `rebuildLootPool()` at boot rather than filtered per roll, because a drop happens in the middle
of a swing. Nothing narrows it and nothing can empty it, so the tier is the only thing a roll asks
about; `dropLoot` still returns null on an empty pool rather than throwing.

`PROFILE.markSeen(id)` is all a profile still remembers about the arsenal, and it gates
**nothing**: it is fired for the local player only (`noteSeen(p, type)`) from the drop pickup and
from the loadout they fly in with, and it puts the blue pip on the ARSENAL row. The page doubles
as a record of what you have actually met in the snow — which, with nothing to research, is the
only thing on it that is about you.

Storage is [js/profile.js](../../js/profile.js) and nothing here writes a key — see
[architecture.md](architecture.md#profilejs).

## The swing tools (E)

The axe and the pick are **not selectable and are not weapons**. `SWING_TOOLS` (`bow`, `axe`,
`pick`, indices `SWING_BOW/AXE/PICK`) is an internal table for icons and names; `p.swing` is what
that player is *holding for work*, and it returns to `SWING_BOW` — which draws the weapon on the
selected slot — the moment a swing ends. Two verbs, two inputs:

- **Left click = the selected tool slot.** The press only records intent (`clickAction` sets
  `input.fire`); `updatePlayer` starts the draw on the rising edge and fires on the falling one.
- **The hands work on their own** (`autoWork(p)`, js/actions.js — `updatePlayer` calls it every
  step `p.input.work` is *not* set). Whatever an `OBJECTS` entry marks `auto` — a tree, a dead
  tree, a berried bush, a rock, a chest, a rival's roosting eagle — and **any building on the
  other team** (`autoToolFor`, resolving a footprint tile through `structOf` and refusing your
  own via `ownsStruct`, exactly as `workTarget` does) is swung at the moment it is inside
  `WORK_REACH`, no key held: `autoTarget(p)` takes the nearest such tile in the ring around
  the player — a rival's building or eagle first (`AUTO_PRIO_FOE`), then a chest (`AUTO_PRIO_PRIZE`), then scenery, and by tile centre to body within a rank (`autoPrio`) — and `startSwing` runs the same swing E's would. What makes it
  automatic and not a cancel: it never drops a draw or the held button (`p.autoSwing` lets the
  draw begin under it, and the release fires on the frame the button lifts, swing or no swing),
  never stands a crawler up (`p.prone` waits, unlike E), and never touches the aim (`startSwing`
  leaves the facing alone while a draw is running, so the aim never flicks toward the tile) — you
  keep shooting, walking or drawing through it, and the tree comes down beside you, with
  **both tools on the sprite**: the axe or pick sweeping in one hand, the drawn weapon on the aim
  in the other (`drawHeldTool`, [below](#the-draw)). It obeys the
  same busy gates as E (a fall, a roll, a stun, an ability, a meal, the swing cooldown).
  **Fish are the same idea on ice** (`autoFish(p, dt)`, js/tools.js, called right after it):
  standing on an ice tile with a fish inside `FISH_CATCH_R` catches it with no press, once
  every `FISH_AUTO_CD` (1.2 s, `p.fishCd`) so a walk along a shoal is a stride per fish, and
  and nothing can refuse the catch, because fish go in the pouch. It spends no tool cycle and runs
  under a draw. **The press no longer spears**: `fireTool` fires whatever is loaded, fish or no
  fish. Nothing in this is a key: the swing itself, the catch pose and the rim are the whole
  signal, so `drawWorkHint` shows no prompt over an `auto` target and the fish brackets carry
  no verb (bright inside catch reach, dim outside).
- **E = work** (`tryWork(p)`, auto-repeating every swing cooldown while held — `updatePlayer`
  calls it whenever `p.input.work` is set, and a held E always beats the hands' own choice).
  It is what reaches **bare ice** (cracking toward a hole) and **the practice dummy** —
  the two things not marked `auto` — and it still works anything else if you insist. It resolves `workTarget(p)`: the tile that player is
  aiming at, if it holds a tree or a dead tree (→ axe), rock (→ pick), a berried bush (→ axe), or
  is bare ice with no object (→ pick, cracking toward a fishing hole); and `near` = the tile is
  within `WORK_REACH` (1) tiles, Chebyshev, of the tile the player stands on — i.e. the 3×3
  ring around you, never a second row, regardless of where in your tile you stand. Out of reach or nothing workable, E
  does nothing. A valid target swaps `p.swing` to the right one, drops any draw, faces the
  tile, and starts the swing; `swingHit(p)` **contests** the locked tile (`p.workTx/Ty`) so only
  one player's swing lands on it in a step, then hits whatever is there via
  `hitObject(o, p)`/`crackIce()`. Once `swingT` and `swingCd`
  both reach 0, `updatePlayer` puts the weapon back (`p.swing = SWING_BOW`), so the axe only
  exists visually for the duration of the work. `workTarget()` is shared with the cursor, so the
  lock ring is exactly "E will do something here".

Whenever `workTarget()` is non-null and `near` (and tools aren't blocked or the bow drawn),
`drawWorkHint()` — called right after `drawSelection` in the overlay pass — floats a
Fortnite-style key prompt over the target: a pixel key-cap wearing the work key (**E** until rebound) plus the verb
(CHOP / MINE / PICK / BREAK / CRACK ICE), lifted above trees by 20 px and short objects by 10 —
a building instead clears its own sprite (which is drawn up from the footprint's bottom edge and
can be taller than its tiles) and centres the prompt on the footprint, not the tile aimed at. The cap
visibly presses (face drops a pixel, highlight gone, label goes gold) while the local player's
`input.work` is set.
If the prompt would overlap the player sprite (an adjacent target) it flips under the tile
instead. Since it only appears in reach, it doubles as the "you're close enough" signal.

`hitObject()` keeps its hard tool gating (trees need the axe, rocks the pick, with
`SFX.deny` + a `NEEDS AXE`/`NEEDS PICKAXE` floater) as a safety net, but since `tryWork`
always picks the right tool it is no longer reachable in normal play; buildings are not gated
at all, since the axe is the only tool E ever brings out for one.

**Stumps and open ice holes** are not E targets — they are the right-click wheel's domain (`buildSiteAt`). **Buildings on another
team are**: `workTarget()` resolves the tile through `structOf()` (so any tile of a 3×2 footprint
counts, via its `part`) and returns the axe when `ownsStruct()` is false, and `swingHit` routes
the swing to the anchor. Your own buildings stay wheel-only, so E is never ambiguous. See
[Base building](#base-building) for the damage numbers. There is still no melee against animals:
the tool on the selected slot is the only weapon aimed at a living thing.

Every tool is **hold-to-charge**: holding the button arms the shot (`p.fireArmed`), the draw
starts as soon as the tool is actually ready and runs `p.charging`/`p.chargeT` (movement targets
scale to 55% — walk speed and the ice cap both — facing tracks the mouse, a draw meter renders
above the player's health bar), and the release edge fires via `fireTool(p)`. The draw scales the
shot's range, speed and damage together ([The draw](#the-draw)) and a shot loosed out of full snow
cover multiplies the damage by `AMBUSH_MUL` (see [Prone](#prone-under-the-snow)). Shots carry
their shooter's `owner`/`team`, live in the `arrows` array, and are updated in `updatePlay()`:
they die on solid tiles (unless the bit passes through them), on a **rival player** (tested first
— see [PvP](multiplayer.md#pvp)), on an **enemy worker bot** (`robotHit`/`hurtRobot`, tested
next), on any animal hit (knockback scales with power), or at the end of the bit's life. They
never hit structures — a building is broken by hand with E, not shot. However a shot ends, it is
**gone** — nothing lands in the snow to be retrieved.

`p.fireArmed` is what makes the draw survive a tool that isn't ready. It is set on the press edge,
cleared on release and at every point that cancels a draw (`tryWork`, falling in a hole, an
overlay opening in `sampleHumanInput`, changing slot, `die`), and the draw begins on the first
step where it is set *and* `nockT <= 0` *and* `toolReady(p)` (a tool whose budget reaches at
least one projectile). Requiring a fresh press instead
would deadlock every controller that simply holds the button down — which is every bot:
`updateAI` sets `inp.fire = chargeT < bowCharge * k`, so after a shot it goes straight back to
true and no second edge ever arrives. `p.chargeT` is the raw seconds held and is **never
clamped** — every reader takes `drawPow(p)` (0..1) off it, and the meter's white blink at the
peak needs to see the hold run past the full draw.

### The cycle

There is no ammunition. What sits between one press and the next is **the tool's own cycle**:
`fireTool` sets `p.nockT = toolCycle(p)` — the held tool's `rof` in game steps, scaled by the
same `kit.nock` factor QUICKDRAW, QUICK HANDS, FLETCHER'S TOUCH and RELENTLESS shorten
(`toolRof`); bare hands' `kit.nock` when no tool is up — and no
draw can begin while that runs. Its end is the **one** gate: the frame the wipe clears, a held
button starts the draw. `toolCycle` is also the one number every readout divides `nockT` by —
the well's wipe, the reticle's corner marks and the overhead slate bar — so no meter can show a
cooldown a different length from the one running (the overhead bar used to divide by the bare
`kit.nock`, and sat at 1 px for half of every reload). Dying spills nothing and refills nothing,
because there is nothing to refill.

Three indicators carry it, and none is a word (the hud strip's weapon well only reddens its rim
when the selected tool cannot answer — an empty slot, or a tensile budget that reaches no shot):

- **The weapon well** (`drawToolCell`) — the top-down cooldown wipe, the same cover every
  ability well cools by, over exactly `toolCycle`. When the wipe is gone, the bow is ready.
  Always.
- **The overhead bar** (`drawPlayer`) — the draw meter's slot doubles as the cycle readout for
  *every* player: gold filling = drawing, slate filling = reloading, pale gold = just came back.
  Same geometry either way, so it never jumps.
- **The reticle** (`cursorInfo` → `drawCursor`). Every reticle in play carries `nock` (elapsed
  fraction, 1 = ready) and `dry`, whatever the pointer is over. While the cycle runs, four gold
  corner marks fall inward and land on the ring; a dry tool drops the centre pixel and greys the
  ticks — the crosshair goes hollow.

Sounds: `SFX.nock()` on the cycle completing (very quiet — it plays after every shot) and
`SFX.dryFire()` on an empty press.

### The draw

`drawPow(p)` — `chargeT` over the kit's `bowCharge`, clamped 0..1 — scales the shot three ways
at once, each on a straight line from a floor to the bit's own number (the `the draw` banner,
js/tools.js):

| | at a tap (`pw` 0) | at full draw | floor |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| range | ×`DRAW_RANGE_MIN` | ×1 | 0.22 |
| speed | ×`DRAW_SPEED_MIN` | ×1 | 0.6 |
| damage (the whole sum: bit + kit + level, before modifiers) | ×`DRAW_DMG_MIN` | ×1 | 0.3 |

`shotFlight(b, m, pw)` turns that into the `spd` and `life` a bit leaves the tool with, the
modifiers' envelope folded in and the range curve applied through the life, so a tap also *stops
short* rather than only arriving late. It is the one envelope: `emitBit` fires through it and
`drawAimLine` measures it, which is what lets the line on the ground grow out of the bow as the
string comes back. A plain arrow off the shortbow: 60 px and 4 damage at a tap, 272 px and 18 at
full. **That curve is the whole punishment for spamming the button** — short, slow and weak, with
the cycle still to run before the next — dealt by the shot itself rather than by a counter, so
what a player sees (a stubby line, a pale meter) is exactly what they get. Bots read the same
curve: `updateAI` holds to `bowCharge × k` before loosing.

A shot in flight is drawn in its own pass (using `ex`/`ey`). A bit may name a **body** of its own
and `BIT_BODY` (js/render.js) is the only place those names mean anything, so a new silhouette is
one row in `BITS` and one row there rather than an `if` in the shots pass: `tumble` is a spinning
5×5 block (`drawTumbler`, the log), `mote` a breathing rimmed core with no bearing at all
(`drawMote`, the wisp), `fist` and `axe` are ASCII maps in the arrow's own language stamped as a
**block** rather than a spine (`FIST_MAP`/`AXE_MAP` → `drawSwungBody`, rimmed by `paintRimmed` —
the fist's jagged leading edge is its knuckles, the axe is a four-px wedge on a six-px haft), and
`warp` is not a shape at all: three bars snapping to fresh angles every `WARP_FLICK` (0.03 s)
over a white core, so the thing crossing the snow visibly does not obey it. Everything else is
**the one arrow body**: `ARROW_MAP`
(js/actions.js), an ASCII master parsed once into `ARROW_BODY` — a white tip, a tapered flint
head, a 1 px collar in the bit's own `col` (the bit is readable from the collar; the shaft never
recolours), a single-gold shaft, and swept swallow-tail feathers in `TEAMS[a.team].mark` edged
with the team's `coatD` — so whose shot it is reads from the tail. `arrowBodyPx`
(js/draw-world.js) rasterises it at the live bearing by **DDA** — the spine advances exactly one
pixel along the flight's dominant axis per step (a diagonal shaft is a clean 8-connected
staircase, never a lumpy one with doubled cells), body columns are sampled onto that chain with
structural pixels winning collisions (`ARROW_BODY` is priority-sorted at parse), and each vane
row sits one exact pixel further out along the perpendicular's dominant axis, so rows never
collapse together and the two vanes stay mirrored at every angle. At the four cardinals this
degenerates to plain rounding, so straight shots kept their exact pre-2.28 pixels. `paintArrowPx` dilates every pixel into `ARROW_RIM` first (a plus-shaped
1 px dark edge) so the shaft reads over snow. The body is built into the `ARROW_PX` scratch
array; `a.x`/`a.y` is the TIP (the point the sim tests) and the body trails `ARROW_LEN` (15) px
behind it, which is why the view cull uses the widened ±22 bound. The whole body is 16 long by
7 deep — one 16×16 sprite cell, the scale everything else in the world is drawn at.

Behind it, each shot lays a **trail of team-coloured motes** into `particles` (fire instead, if a
FLAME modifier is riding it — the burn is the more urgent fact about that shot than whose it is),
one every
`ARROW_TRAIL_STEP` (4) px of *flight distance* — not per tick, so a slow arrow streaks as evenly
as a fast one, and a long frame is subdivided instead of leaving a gap. Motes are dropped at the
distance behind the TAIL they are owed (`a.trailD` banks the remainder; a shaft's body runs
`ARROW_LEN` px behind the tip, so the trail flows off the fletching — and none lay until the tail
has cleared the bow, `a.flown`), drift back at 8 px/s and
fade from `ARROW_TRAIL_A` (0.7) over `ARROW_TRAIL_LIFE` (0.22 s), leaving a tail that thins out
behind the shot. The particle draw pass is what makes that possible: a particle's
`maxLife` is the seconds it spends fading (`burst` uses 0.4) and its optional `alpha` caps how
opaque it ever gets. Particles draw before the arrows, so a trail always sits under its own shaft.
Switching tools, opening an overlay, or dying drops the draw without firing (and clears
`fireArmed` with it); `BOW_CHARGE` (0.9 s) is a full draw.

While a tool is drawn, `drawAimLine()` (called from `render()` right before the shots pass, using
`ex`/`ey`) shows the shot: a static line of 2×2 drop-shadowed dots from the spawn point along the
exact direction `emitBit()` uses. Both aim from `player.y - BOW_Y` (6 px above the feet, where the
shot spawns) — not the feet — so the line and the flight pass exactly through the cursor instead
of running parallel a few px above it.

The line is **truthful, not decorative**, and it is truthful about the **bit that is up next**
(`toolPlan`'s lead shot) at the **draw held right now**, not about a bow in general: it runs
exactly as far
as that bit would fly if loosed this instant (`shotFlight` — speed × life through the tool's
modifiers and the draw curve, so it grows out of the bow as the string comes back, and a tap's
line is a stub), and only stops at an `isSolidTile` if that
bit is one a wall stops. It still stops at the first animal it would hit (the same 8 px body test
as the arrow update) with an impact cross — line-coloured on a solid, hunt-amber on a body — and
otherwise ends in a short perpendicular range-cap bar. A `lob` gets only the first 35% of its
flight, where it is still on the bearing; a `boomer` or an `orbit` gets **no line at all**, since
the only honest straight line for those is none — what they do is shown by the shot itself the
moment it leaves. Colour follows the draw meter: gold charging, pale gold at full (`DRAW_COL` / `DRAW_FULL_COL`,
draw-world.js).

The weapon is also drawn **on the player** by `drawHeldTool()` (called from `drawPlayer()`): at
rest the hands hold the tool on the *selected slot*, in its own tier colour, so what someone is
carrying reads off their sprite from across the snow — and an empty slot reads as empty hands.
It is carried at the hand while idle/walking (mirrored via a `scale(-1,1)` transform for `left`,
drawn *before* the body sprite for `up` so it's occluded, 1px walk bob), and rotated toward the
mouse while drawn — the bow art fires along −x (arc on the left), so aim rotation is `a + PI`.
A melee swing sweeps the axe or pick's icon along the swing arc instead, and a swing running
under a draw (an automatic one — `autoWork`) draws **both**: the sweep first, the drawn weapon
on top, since the shot about to leave is the thing to read.
Mid-swing the axe or pick takes over, swept along the same arc as the swing effect. Both sizes go
through the same code: the icon is centred on its own half-width, 8×8 for a swing tool and 12×12
for a weapon.

## Dodge roll

**Space** (`tryDodge(p)`, driven by the edge-triggered `input.dodge`) dashes a player along its
`input.mx/my` (facing direction if nothing is held): an impulse of
`max(DODGE_SPEED (215), current speed)` into `p.vx/vy`
for `DODGE_T` (0.28 s), with i-frames for the roll only (`p.invuln` — momentum carried
past the roll gets no i-frames). It is the **only** i-frame a fight produces: taking a hit grants
none ([i-frames](#i-frames-only-something-deliberate-grants-them)), so the roll is the whole answer
to a volley. Two charges (`DODGE_CHARGES`), refilling **one at a time**
every `DODGE_CD` (3.5 s); state lives on the player as `dodgeT/dodgeVX/dodgeVY/dodgeCharges/
dodgeRegenT/dodgeDustT` (`dodgeVX/VY` exist only for the spin/ghost render — movement runs on
`vx/vy`). While rolling, movement input, friction, footprints, walk animation, and the held
tool are suppressed (still collides with solids; a wall zeroes that axis), and `drawPlayer`
swaps to a full 360° sprite spin with two afterimage ghosts trailing the velocity plus dust
bursts. The roll's exit speed is spent by the surface — see
[Momentum movement](#momentum-movement-players-only). The charge meter is a single unsegmented cyan stamina
bar on a plate directly beneath the overhead health bar — charges stay discrete in the sim,
the bar shows the pooled total (full charges + regen progress). Spending a charge leaves a
pale ghost of the lost chunk (`player.stamGhost`/`stamGhostT`): it holds ~0.3 s, then drains
into the live fill souls-style. Death cancels the roll, respawn refills
charges; pause, the settings panel and the wheel block the local player's roll (the
[map](#the-m-map-does-not-pause) does not). The bar is drawn for
the local player only — a rival's tells are their draw meter and their position. A roll out of
[prone](#prone-under-the-snow) is legal and is the fast way out of the snow: `tryDodge` stands the
player up first, so the escape costs a charge.

### The roll is a hit

A dash is a body thrown at whatever is in front of it. Every step of the roll, `rollSweep(p)`
takes everything inside `ROLL_HIT_R` (7px) of the roller's own radius and splits it two ways:

- **Small — rabbits, wolves, robots, other players.** One swipe each, **once per roll**
  (`p.rollHit`, cleared by `tryDodge` and again when the roll ends), and the roll goes straight
  **through** them: `separateUnits` skips any pair where one side is a live roll and the other is
  small, so there is nothing to bump against. Friendly bots and teammates are passed through
  untouched — you roll *under* them, you do not run them down. A rival with i-frames up (mid-roll
  of their own) refuses the whole thing, damage and stun both, so **rolls cancel rolls**.
- **Big — a deer, a tree, a rock, a building.** A **tackle**: both sides take it, both are
  stunned, and the roll ends on the spot. `rollTackle` drops the roller's own i-frames first,
  because the tackle is the one hit a roll cannot dodge, and bounces them back off the contact.
  A wall only counts when it is taken head-on — the speed actually driven into the axis
  `moveEntity` refused has to clear `TACKLE_MIN` (120 px/s), so brushing past a pine at a run is
  free and dashing straight into one is not. `tackleObject` puts real damage into an **enemy
  building** (it has an hp pool); a tree or a rock only shudders, because its `hp` is a chop count
  behind a tool gate and a shoulder is not an axe. Fish are under the ice and are in none of it — and
  nor is a **fish net**, which is not solid, so a roll crosses one without a contact at all.

**Everything scales with the speed the roll is actually carrying** — `rollPow` runs from the
class's own `kit.dodgeSpeed` up to `ROLL_FAST` (340 px/s), which is why a dash launched out of
an ice slide deals `ROLL_DMG`'s top end (16 and a 1.1s stun) against 5 and 0.5s off a standing
start. That is the whole reason to chain a dash out of momentum instead of from rest. All three
kinds take it through the same `hurtUnit` + `stunUnit` pair
([status effects](#status-effects-one-set-for-every-unit)) — the loops differ only in their radius
and their once-per-roll bookkeeping.

## Status effects: one set for every unit

Everything in this section lives under the **`status effects`** banner at the foot of
[js/actions.js](../../js/actions.js). Three kinds of thing walk this world — a **player**, an
**animal**, a **worker bot** — and anything that can hurt one can hurt all three the same way. That
is not a coincidence to be re-established per feature; it is what these funnels are for:

| Reach for | When |
| --- | --- |
| `hurtUnit(e, dmg, nx, ny, src, o)` | **any** blow. `o` = `{ type, kb, kbMul, cause, ambush, crit, burn, burnDps }` — `kb` the absolute px/s of shove an ability picks, `kbMul` the multiplier on whatever shove that kind takes anyway ([knockback](#knockback-one-number-thrown-at-three-weights)). Routes to `damagePlayer` / `hurtAnimal` / `hurtRobot`, which stay for what is genuinely per-kind (a den waking, a worker turning on whoever hit it) |
| `unitsNear(src, x, y, r)` | every living thing in a circle that `src` may touch — players, wildlife **and** bots in one list |
| `unitsHit(src, x, y, r)` | the same, minus anyone whose i-frames are up: the list a **blow** sweeps, so a rival mid-roll is untouchable. A lasting ground *condition* (a crater) wants `unitsNear` — a condition is not a hit, and a roll should not shrug one off |
| `stunUnit` `rootUnit` `slowUnit` `netUnit` `markUnit` `igniteUnit` | the one place each state is written. Each takes the worse/longer of what is already on the body |
| `unitMoveMul(e)` | what is left of a non-player's speed — `abilityMoveMul`'s twin. Spent inside `navStep`, so one edit slows every walker; the two movers that steer themselves rather than route (a loitering bot, a bird in flight) fold it in by hand |
| `clearUnitStatus(e)` / `douseUnit(e)` | a fresh body, and a fire put out. Called by `Player.reset`, `die`, `makeAnimal`, `makeRobot` |

`unitFoe(src, e)` is the side rule they all share, and it is where **wildlife being neutral** is
written down once: an animal has no `team` (`unitTeam` → −1), so it is nobody's friend and
everybody's fair game — exactly how the world already treated a deer. `sideOf(w)` hands one of these
lists the side of a **thing in the world** — a net, a shot in flight — rather than a living
caster, so a net outlives the hunter who threw it and still knows whose it was; `abCredit(w)`
(js/abilities.js) is its other half, and pays a kill to nobody once that caster is down.

### I-frames: only something deliberate grants them

`p.invuln` (players only — an animal or a worker bot has no such field and never had) counts down
in `updatePlayer` and is read by every picker at once: the arrow loop skips a player that has it,
`unitsHit` drops one, `rollSweep` passes over one, and `damagePlayer` returns early on one. **A hit
sets it nowhere.** As of **PATCH 3.01** the only things that grant it are deliberate:

| Granted by | For | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tryDodge` | `DODGE_T` + 0.05 s | the roll *is* the dodge — [Dodge roll](#dodge-roll) |
| `Player.reset` — so `respawnPlayer` | 3 s (0 on the very first spawn) | nobody is spawn-camped |
| `landPlayer`, `practiceRevive` | 2 s | a beat of grace while the snow settles |
| the ice-hole scramble (`updatePlayer`, js/sim.js) | 0.8 s | you climb out; you are not bitten climbing out |
| the drop briefing (`js/boot.js`) | 0.4 s, refreshed | the lesson is not a fight |

`rollTackle` **drops** them first, because the tackle is the one hit a roll cannot dodge.

Before PATCH 3.01 every blow also handed the body 0.7 s of grace, which meant the second of two
shots arriving in the same step was silently thrown away — and since **PATCH 3.00** one press puts
a whole volley in the air ([tools and bits](#tools-and-bits)), so a close-range column landing two
or three bits on one body was paying for one. Now each lands its own damage, its own shove and its
own fire. Two consequences worth knowing: the **wolf pack** lost its cap
([Camp monsters](#camp-monsters-neutral-until-hit)), and
a body can take several hits in one frame — `SFX.hurt()`’s 0.03 s `gap` collapses the oofs into
one so they do not phase, while the damage floaters, the red flash, the shove and the shake are
per hit. Knockback does not accumulate: the last blow of a step writes `kbx`/`kby` outright.

The six states, and what each does to a body:

| state | field | what it does | the tell on the body |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **stun** | `stunT`/`stunMax` | a player has every intent dropped out of `p.input` at the top of `updatePlayer` (movement, fire, work, slide, the edge-triggered lot) rather than each action refusing separately, so a human and an AI fill are pinned by the identical window — the draw, the swing in flight and any roll are cancelled outright; an animal or a bot skips its brain for the window in `updateAnimal`/`updateRobot`. Never touches velocity: whatever hit you still slides you | three sparks orbiting (`drawStunStars`) |
| **root** | `rootT` | move multiplier 0 — no walk, no roll, no slide; tools still work. Currently no ability or bit sets it — the state and its tell stay with the universal set ([Known drift](checklists.md#known-drift)) | sprung iron jaws at the feet |
| **slow** | `slowT`/`slowMul` | the multiplier on every speed cap | — (the net's drape says it, when a net is why) |
| **net** | `netT` | the slow, plus the reason for it | a mesh drape over the sprite |
| **mark** | `markT` | on a player, `seenAt()` returns full range and both maps keep drawing them (its one legal bypass); an animal or a bot has no cover to strip, so it is the reveal alone. Like root, currently sourceless — kept with the set | gold chevrons falling toward the head |
| **fire** | `burnT`/`burnDps`/`burnBy` | see below | flame tongues off the crown, and lit snow under the feet |

Every one of them is **drawn on the body, for both sides**, at whatever size that body is —
`drawUnitStates(e, px, py, w, h, now)` (js/abilities.js) takes the sprite's own box and is called by
`drawAbilityOnPlayer`, `drawAnimal`, `drawBird` and `drawRobot` alike. A state you cannot see is a
rule you cannot play around, and that is as true of a deer as of a rival. The player keeps two tells
of its own on top (a raised shield, the juggernaut's rim), and the stun badge is the one visual that
differs by kind: over an animal or a robot the sparks sit above the health bar, while on a player
they ride a badge that **mirrors the level badge on the other side of the overhead frame** — same
backing and track, its left frame column shared with the health bar backing's right edge — whose
5×5 track drains from the bottom as the window runs out (`stunMax` is the height it drains from).
It is drawn for every player, like the stamina bar: a rival seeing stars is a tell worth having.

### Damage types, and fire

A blow carries a **type**, and `DMG_TYPES` is what a type *is* — the sparks it throws off a body and
how long it leaves that body burning. `blunt` is everything that always existed (an arrow, an axe, a
shoulder) and is the default when nothing names one.

**`fire` is the one type that outlives its own blow.** It ignites what it lands on; an ignited unit
then pays `burnDps` in bites `BURN_TICK` (0.4 s) apart until its clock runs out — `BURN_T` 3 s at
`BURN_DPS` 6 for a plain fire hit. A fresh ignition **refreshes** the clock (capped at `BURN_MAX`,
8 s) and takes the hotter of the two rates rather than lighting a second fire, so a SPLITTER fan
sets you properly alight instead of banking half a minute of it. Credit rides along in `burnBy`, so
burning to death is a kill for whoever struck the light (`KILL_VERB.fire` — "BURNED"; with nobody to
credit, `DEATH_CAUSE.fire` — "BURNED IN THE SNOW").

Two rules make the burn behave like fire rather than like a stream of small arrows:

- **`DOT_CAUSE`** (js/player.js) — a bite of fire is *not a blow*. It goes **through** the i-frames
  a body does have — a roll does not put a fire out, and neither does a respawn — and never shoves:
  a burn is a condition on the body, not a blow landing on it. (Before **PATCH 3.01** it also had
  to dodge the 0.7 s of grace every hit granted, which would have swallowed the whole burn — see
  [i-frames](#i-frames-only-something-deliberate-grants-them).) It still breaks cover and the meal:
  you cannot lie hidden, or eat, while you are alight.
- **The tick's own damage type is `burn`, not `fire`** — otherwise the bite would relight the fire
  dealing it and nothing would ever go out.

Where fire comes from: the three **fire modifier bits**
([tools and bits](#tools-and-bits)) — FLAME, PYRE, CINDER BURST. Nothing else on the map is on fire:
the roosting eagle is an objective with its own damage path, not a unit, and takes no status at all.

## Prone: under the snow

**SNOW COVER — the HUNTER's key 4** — lies a player face-down in the snow and pulls it over them.
It is the game's only stealth, it belongs to one class now, and once under it is paid for
entirely in speed; the way IN costs the ability's 60 s cooldown
([class abilities](#class-abilities-keys-1-4)), and every way back up is free. There is no
dedicated burrow key any more — `input.prone` is gone from the input struct, and Ctrl does
nothing (it was always a browser-shortcut minefield anyway: Ctrl+W closes the tab and
`preventDefault()` cannot stop it).

`tryProne(p)`/`risePlayer(p)` (the `actions` banner) are still the only two ways in and out —
`abSnowCover` (js/abilities.js) is the one caller of `tryProne` and refunds the clock when the
snow refuses. Going down
needs **both feet still** (`hypot(vx, vy) <= PRONE_ENTER`, 14 px/s — you cannot dive at a run),
not sliding, not mid-roll, and **snow underfoot**: a river has nothing to dig into, and the press
there is denied before the kneel even starts. Getting up happens on key 4 again, on the ambush
shot, on a `tryWork` E
press, on `tryDodge` (a roll is the fast way out and costs a charge), on any hit
(`damagePlayer` calls `risePlayer` before anything else), on falling through the ice, and on death.

### The one number

`p.hide` (0..1) is the whole state. It climbs at `1 / kit.bury` (starts at `PRONE_BURY` 1.5 s,
shortened by ambush ranks) while lying **still on
snow**, holds while crawling, decays fast off snow — a body dragged onto bare ice keeps the pose
but loses the cover, because the cover is the snow, not the posture — and is zeroed the instant
`risePlayer` runs. Two derived reads sit on top of it and **everything else in the game uses
those, never `p.hide` directly**:

- `concealOf(p)` = `hide`, discounted to `PRONE_MOVE` (×0.5) while `p.moving`. A crawling mound is
  worth half a still one, which is what makes "stop before you shoot" a real decision.
- `seenAt(p, range)` = the distance a watcher with plain sight `range` actually notices p from:
  `range × kit.stealth × (1 − PRONE_CUT × conceal)`, floored at `PRONE_SNIFF` (22 px) whenever
  there is any cover at all — **nothing hides at arm's length**. Full cover takes a bot's 150 px
  down to 22 and a tier-3 turret's 92 down to 22.

Three watchers resolve through `seenAt` and there must never be a fourth that doesn't:
`aiNearestEnemy` (which **ignored `kit.stealth` entirely** before this — GHOSTSTEP did nothing
against another player until now) and `turretMark`/`turretHolds` — a camp monster has no sight
to resolve, since a hit is its only trigger ([Camp monsters](#camp-monsters-neutral-until-hit)).
Both maps gate separately on `concealOf(p) >= PRONE_MAP` (0.55): a rival buried and still drops off
the minimap and the M map, and a rival *crawling* tops out at 0.5 and stays on both — moving puts
you back on their map before it puts you back in their sights.

### Crawling

`updatePlayer`'s movement block forces the plain direct-approach branch with
`walkMax = PRONE_SPEED` (20 px/s against a 72 px/s walk) on **any** surface — no ice cap, no
`chargeMul`, nothing to stack, and `inp.slide` is ignored (`wantSlide` requires `!p.prone`).
Rising costs `PRONE_RISE` (0.34 s) at 45% walk speed. Instead of footprints a crawl lays a **drag
furrow**: `k: 3` entries in the shared `footprints` array every 2 px, each storing the
perpendicular it was pushed with so the trough draws square to the path whichever way it went, two
deep so consecutive marks tile into one continuous line, with an elbow dimple to one side on every
other mark. It keeps the full 9 s footprint life — a trail worth following has to outlast the crawl
that made it — and it is the counterplay: a line like that leads straight to the mound at the end.

### The ambush shot

`ambushReady(p)` is `prone && hide >= 1 && !moving`: **full** cover, and dead still while it goes.
`fireTool` reads it before anything else can break the cover, multiplies the whole damage roll
(class + power + speed + level) by `kit.ambushMul` (starts at `AMBUSH_MUL` 2.5, grown by ambush
ranks), tags the arrow `ambush: true`, and calls
`risePlayer` after the loose — one ambush per burrow, then you are a player lying in the open with
a bow that still has to be renocked. A HUNTER's full draw goes 12 → 30. Bow-fishing is the exception
that proves the rule: it never leaves the bow, so it costs no arrow and breaks no cover.

Wherever the tagged arrow lands — player, worker bot or animal — `ambushFx()` puts a gold flare
over the ordinary hit puff and plays `SFX.ambush()`; `damagePlayer`'s `crit` argument runs the
damage floater hotter and at double scale, and doubles the local shake.

### The tells

None of them is a word:

- **The body disappears.** `drawSnowCover` closes over the prone sprite **from the outside in** —
  boots and elbows first, the middle of the back last — so at 85% there is still a seam of coat
  showing down the spine. Row extents come from `spr.spans`, the per-row `[firstX, lastX]`
  [sprites.md](sprites.md) takes off the char grid at bake time, dilated a row into its neighbours
  so it is a drift rather than a traced outline; the finished mound is lit like every other drift
  here (white crest, shaded far side, dark rim under it doing the grounding a prone body's missing
  cast shadow would have done). Alpha is 1 for a rival, 0.85 for an ally and 0.66 for yourself, so
  **you can always see yourself under the snow** and nobody else can.
- **The overhead furniture fades with the cover** (`drawPlayer`) — name tag, health bar, stamina
  bar, level badge, and the draw meter that says a shot is coming. A rival keeps none of it. The
  whole stack also drops 6 rows with the pose, since a prone body starts that much lower in the
  same 16×16 cell.
- **The bury ring** (`drawBuryRing`, local player only) — twelve marks on a ring in the snow that
  light one at a time as the cover builds, then flash white and go. Each gets a dark pixel under
  it, because white on snow is white on white. A rival needs no meter: they can watch you vanish.
- **The reticle arms.** `cursorInfo` puts `amb` on every reticle it builds; `drawCursor` grows a
  second segment out along each of the crosshair's own axes and warms the centre pixel to gold —
  deliberately on the cross, where the renock's marks are on the diagonals.
- **Breath.** One timer on the player does two jobs, and which one says what state the body is in:
  while the cover is still building it throws up the snow being pulled over, and once it is
  finished it becomes a plume of breath every ~2 s. That, the mound itself and the furrow are the
  three things that keep "almost invisible" honest.

### Bots

A hunter bot casts it through the same ability key a human presses (`inp.ability = 3`) — rung 2
of the [ladder](multiplayer.md#bots), decided before the rest because two later rungs read
the answer; a warrior bot has no burrow to decide.

## Wildlife

`animals` holds **everything that is shot rather than swung at** — two kinds of prey, the camps' three wolves and the dormant bird, keyed by
`a.kind` with hp from `ANIMAL_HP`. The passive pair is spawned at boot by `spawnAnimals()`
(called right after `genWorld()`, so its `rng()` draws don't reshuffle the world layout) at
`PREY_POP` strength: 16 rabbits (8 HP, biased to spawn near berry bushes) and 10 deer (24 HP).
Neither reproduces, but **the meadow is restocked**: `updatePreyStock` (from `updatePlay`, never
under `PRACTICE`) puts one animal of the kind furthest under strength back every `PREY_REPOP`
(15 s) through `spawnPrey`, on a free tile no live player is within `PREY_CLEAR` (280 px — past
the edge of any screen at zoom 1) of, so nothing is ever seen to appear. **Wolves** (30 HP), the
**alpha** (70) and the **dire wolf** (320) belong to a [camp](world.md#camps) instead — `a.home` points at it,
and the camp restocks them, all at once, once it is cleared. (**Birds**, 3 HP, are dormant: nothing spawns one.)

**Every animal wears a level** (`a.level`), the hero's plate on the left of its frame
([rendering.md](rendering.md#overhead-health-bars)), dealt once by `makeAnimal` from
`animalLevel()` — the **average hero level of the active players**, rounded, capped at
`LEVEL_MAX` — and never raised after: an animal does not level, the meadow does, as the ones
the eagle dropped you into (all level 1) are shot and restocked at whatever the table has
reached. What grows with it is hp, `ANIMAL_LV_HP` a level over `ANIMAL_HP` (rabbit +1, deer
+2, wolf +3, alpha +8, dire +25; a level-6 pack is 45 hp a wolf), and a camp monster's bite (`MONSTER.lvBite`: +1, +2, +3 a level).
**The kill pays for it**: `animalDies` grows the `YIELD` payout by `ANIMAL_LV_GOLD` (a tenth)
a level, rounded, before the HUNTSMAN bonus is taken off it — a level-6 rabbit is 15 gold, a
level-6 wolf 36, and a level-12 beast a little over twice its level-1 self, about what its hp
grew by. Gold is XP, so a richer meadow lifts the table that made it richer, but at a tenth a
level it is a slope, not a farm.

**The noticed mark.** An animal that has a player in sight wears a `!` over its head — the
`drawSenseMark` glyph in [rendering.md](rendering.md#overhead-health-bars), stamina white on
prey and threat red on a wolf — for as long as it does: `a.senseT` counts the seconds since it
first did and is 0 whenever it does not. For prey, "in sight" is a player inside the
`FLEE_SIGHT` ring (through `seenAt`, so cover keeps it down) **or a flight already under way**,
so a deer running wears the reason it is running and a deer that grazes on has not seen you; for
a camp monster it is a hunt in progress and nothing else — a leash bar still draining is still
a hunt — and the mark going out is the monster giving you up. The **body** says the same thing
at a distance where a `!` is a speck — see the clips below.

### What a beast is doing: the clips

The bunny and the stag arrived as *behaviours* rather than as poses — a graze, a gallop, a
sit-up ([sprites.md](sprites.md)) — so a beast's animation is not a walk flag any more but a
name. `ANIM_CLIPS` (js/wildlife.js) is the whole of it: a row per kind naming the clips that
kind's `SPRITES` entry carries and the frames a second each runs at. `setClip(a, name)` puts a
beast in one and **restarts the loop**, so a sit-up always begins on the frame it was drawn to
begin on; `stepClip(a, dt, rate)` advances it, `rate` being the caller's own gait multiplier —
a wander is the same gallop run slower, not a second animation; and `clipFrame`
(js/draw-world.js) is the one thing that turns `a.clip` + `a.animT` into a canvas.

| kind | its clips | set by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rabbit` | `idle` low over its paws, `rise` up on its haunches, `hop` | `updatePrey` |
| `deer` | `graze` head down in the snow, `idle` head up and turning, `run` the gallop | `updatePrey` |
| `wolf` / `alpha` / `dire` | `idle`, `run` | `updateCampMonster` |
| `bird` | `idle` perched, `fly` | `updateBird` |

**The head is the tell.** Standing still and settled, a deer's head is DOWN in the snow and a
rabbit is low over its paws; standing still and *wary*, the deer's head is up and turning and
the rabbit is rocked back on its haunches. So **a grazing deer is a deer that has not seen
you** — the fact the `!` carries, said by the body, at a range where the mark is a speck. It is
what makes closing on one under GHOSTSTEP or buried in the snow visibly worth doing.

Wary is `a.wary`, held at `PREY_WARY_T` (3 s) whenever a player is in sight or a flight is
under way and decaying otherwise. It is deliberately softer than `a.senseT`, which snaps to 0:
the mark goes out the instant the animal loses you, the head stays up a moment longer, and a
deer that has just been run **stands and watches before it grazes again**. It costs nothing —
no speed, no sight, no bolt of its own.

**A rabbit sits up before it goes.** `RABBIT_ALERT` (0.3 s): the first time a rabbit notices a
player it rocks onto its haunches and **holds** — no walk, no flight — and only then bolts. It
is what this page's own line ("a rabbit sits tight and then goes off like a spring") looks
like, and it is the one still shot a hunter is ever offered at one. A **hit** skips it
(`hurtAnimal` clears `alertT`), so a rabbit already running never stops to pose; a stun clears
it with everything else; and the jink still fires out of it, because `arrowAtRabbit` is read
before the beat is.

`updateAnimal()` is the shared shell: it ages the flash and knockback, runs
`updateUnitStatus` (the shared clock — root, slow, net, mark, fire), dispatches to
`updatePrey` / `updateCampMonster` / `updateBird`, clamps to the world, and calls `animalDies(a)` — the
one place a kill pays out, straight from the `YIELD` table. Everything in `animals` is a target
for arrows (`animalHit(a, x, y)`, shared by the arrow update and the aim line), gets the amber
hunt reticle, and joins the y-sorted draws.

**An animal is a unit like any other.** `makeAnimal` hands every kind the full status set through
`clearUnitStatus`, so a rabbit, a deer, a wolf and a bird take the same damage and the same six
states from every ability and every bit that a player does — rooted, netted, slowed, marked,
stunned, set alight — and wear the same tells at their own size
([status effects](#status-effects-one-set-for-every-unit)). Nothing about wildlife is exempted
anywhere; what makes them everybody's target rather than nobody's is simply that they carry no
`team`, which `unitFoe` reads as neutral. **A new kind of neutral fauna pushed into `animals` gets
all of it for free** — the checklist for one is in
[checklists.md](checklists.md#common-changes) ("Adding a kind of unit").

Prey behaviour lives in `updatePrey()`, and **every step of it is a routed goal** — grazing
included, which is what keeps the `.` overlay honest ([rendering.md](rendering.md#routes)).

- **Grazing.** Idle, then pick one goal and walk it. `wanderGoal(a, base, spread, near, far)`
  tries 8 tiles in an arc, takes the first it can actually route to, and returns `null` when the
  animal is boxed in (the caller just idles and picks again). `preyWander` is the per-kind
  chooser: a rabbit with a berried bush inside 7 tiles (`nearestBerryBush`) aims at it and
  returns `null` — idling, i.e. "nibbling" — once within 22 px, which is what makes a bush patch
  read as a warren; everyone else takes an open direction, 3–6 tiles. `navStep` walks it at
  `PREY_SPD`, and arriving (or `ok === false`) drops the goal and idles. The walk wears the
  `hop` / `run` clip at 0.6 rate — the same gait as a flight, taken lazily — and the idle at
  the end of it is where a settled deer's head actually goes down.
- **Bolting.** Both species now flee, on `FLEE_SIGHT` / `FLEE_TIME`: a rabbit sits tight and goes
  at 26 px, a deer watches wider and runs longer at 46 px. The trigger asks
  **`seenAt(p, FLEE_SIGHT[kind])`**, not raw distance, so GHOSTSTEP and lying buried in the snow
  are how a hunter closes on a deer at all — measured, full cover collapses a deer's ring from 46
  to `PRONE_SNIFF` (22), and inside *that* it bolts no matter what you are lying under. A hit
  also sends either species running from the nearest player (`fleeT`) — and skips the rabbit's
  `RABBIT_ALERT` sit-up, which only a first *sighting* buys.
- **The flight** is a chain of routed legs at `PREY_RUN`: `fleeGoal(a, from)` picks a tile ~6
  tiles off, as straight away from the threat as the ground allows (fanning out, then sideways,
  then past it), the first it can route to; a leg that arrives or fails hands over to the next,
  and an animal with nowhere to run stops fleeing.
- **A deer's sprint.** A deer always wears a second bar under its health — stamina white
  (`STAM_COL`), stacked the way a player's is (`drawAnimal`) — and spends it on the first stretch
  of every flight: while `a.sprint` (0..1) is above zero the legs run at `DEER_SPRINT` (170 px/s,
  past any walk or slide) and the bar drains over `DEER_SPRINT_T` (2.5 s of running); empty, the
  flight drops to `PREY_RUN` (92) and the deer is catchable on foot. It refills over
  `DEER_SPRINT_REGEN` (10 s) whenever the deer is not fleeing, so the bar is the hunt's read:
  a full one means the deer will simply leave, a low one means run it again now.
- **A rabbit's jink.** A rabbit wears the same white bar (`a.dodge`, 0..1), but it is one
  **dodge charge**, ready only when full. `arrowAtRabbit` looks at every shot in flight each step:
  one inside `RABBIT_DODGE_SIGHT` (90 px), still flying *toward* the rabbit, on a line that passes
  within `RABBIT_DODGE_MISS` (14 px) of its body, is a shot coming at it, and `rabbitDodge` spends
  the charge on a hand-steered dash straight off that line — sideways, to the side the body already
  leans to (the other if that one is a wall, `navLineClear`), at `RABBIT_DODGE_SPD` (260 px/s) for
  `RABBIT_DODGE_T` (0.11 s, ~29 px, clear of the 8 px disc `animalHit` tests) — and then an ordinary
  bolt (`fleeT`) away from the shooter: the zig, then the zag. The charge comes back over
  `RABBIT_DODGE_CD` (10 s) whatever the rabbit is doing, so an empty bar is the read that the
  next arrow lands; a rooted or netted rabbit never spends it. A shot already past or flying
  wide is nothing to it, and a stun drops a dash mid-jink like any other move.

A kill pays its `YIELD` gold, grown a tenth a level for the animal's level (`ANIMAL_LV_GOLD`,
above), straight to whoever landed the final blow (`a.lastHit`, through
`awardGold` — see [Economy](#economy-one-currency)); rabbits also drop 1 berry as a physical
pickup, and a burn credits the player that lit it, so an animal that walks away and dies of its
fire still pays. Shots, rolls and the class abilities are what hurt them (there is no
melee — the E swing is for scenery, never for a body); animals are solid
to players, robots and each other except birds, which fly (see
[Unit collisions](#unit-collisions)), and sprites are side-view only (`dir` is `left|right`).
They are not shown on the minimap or world map.

### Camp monsters: neutral until hit

The [camps](world.md#camps) keep three kinds of wolf — the **wolf** (a den's 4), the **alpha**
(the stone's 1) and the **dire wolf** (the hollow's 1) — one `MONSTER` row each (wildlife.js:
the bite and what it grows a level, the reach, the seconds between one body's bites, the
hunting speed, the body's radius and mass, and `big` for the dire's 2× sprite). All three run
`updateCampMonster()`:

- **Neutral.** There is no sight and no threat bar filling on a linger: a player can stand at
  the mouth of a den and nothing happens. **A hit is the whole trigger** — an arrow, a roll, a
  stomp, anything through `hurtUnit` — and it wakes the *camp*: `wakeCamp(w, hitter)` hands the
  hitter to every monster of the same camp at a full leash bar and plays `SFX.howl()`. Every
  further hit re-aims the camp at the latest hitter, which is how a team takes turns tanking
  it.
- **The leash bar.** `a.threat` (0..1) is the red bar hung under the health bar the way a
  player's stamina is (`THREAT_COL`, `drawAnimal`; bare track at rest). It holds full while
  the quarry is on the camp's **ground** — `CAMP_GROUND` (7) tiles past the camp's `r` — and
  drains over `CAMP_LEASH_T` (3 s) anywhere off it, with the monster at your heels or not; it
  keeps coming while the bar drains and the hunt ends only when the bar is empty. Then it walks
  home and **heals**: a monster with nobody to hunt mends from nothing to full over
  `CAMP_REGEN_T` (6 s), so a fight you break off is a fight reset, never a chip-away. A quarry
  that dies or boards its eagle ends the hunt at once.
- **The chase.** The kind's `spd` — 96 px/s for a wolf, faster than the 72 px/s walk and slower
  than a slide, 90 for the alpha, 80 for the dire — so the answer is the momentum system, not
  distance; every one routes around trees and water ([Pathfinding](#pathfinding)), and a quarry
  it cannot route to (out on a hole) it holds and faces. Bites do the row's `bite` plus `lvBite`
  for every level past the monster's first, inside `reach`, every `cd` seconds *per body*,
  through `damagePlayer(t, dmg, dx, dy, null, cause)` — `'wolf'` (`WENT TO THE WOLVES`) for the
  pack and the alpha, `'dire'` (`FED THE DIRE WOLF`) for the hollow's. **Nothing caps the
  pack**: a hit grants no i-frames ([i-frames](#i-frames-only-something-deliberate-grants-them)),
  so four wolves on you is four bites a second, ~36 hp/s at level 1. `cd` is the only dial on it.
- **Off duty** it patrols its camp on routed legs from the same `wanderGoal` the prey graze with
  (2–5 tiles); once it drifts past `r * 0.8` the arc narrows to 0.5 rad straight back at the
  camp, so the only way it will walk out there is home. Taking a quarry drops the patrol goal.
  The noticed mark (`a.senseT`) is worn on a hunt and nothing else.

| Kind | hp (+ a level) | bite (+ a level) | reach / cd / spd | body | kill |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| wolf | 30 (+3) | 9 (+1) | 13 px / 1 s / 96 | r 4.5, mass 2, a roll passes through | `YIELD.wolf` 24 |
| alpha | 70 (+8) | 12 (+2) | 15 px / 1.2 s / 90 | r 4.5, mass 2.5 | `YIELD.alpha` 40, and the killer wears ALPHA'S BLOOD |
| dire | 320 (+25) | 22 (+3) | 22 px / 1.4 s / 80 | r 9, mass 5, a 2× sprite a roll **tackles** | `YIELD.dire` 90, `EPIC_TEAM_GOLD` (40) to every teammate on the ground, the whole team blooded, a feed line |

Every payout grows `ANIMAL_LV_GOLD` a level like any kill ([Wildlife](#wildlife)). The dire's
teammate share goes through `awardGold` at each teammate's own feet (so a bot's gear purchase can
eat it the same tick — the XP is what is guaranteed), to every active teammate who is not dead
or in the air; the blood goes to every active teammate regardless.

**ALPHA'S BLOOD** (`campBuff(p, t)`, the constants above the `camp monsters` banner): `p.buffT`
seconds during which every blow the player lands is `CAMP_BUFF_DMG` (×1.25, applied in
`hurtUnit` — a shot, a roll and a stomp alike) and the walk is `CAMP_BUFF_SPD` (×1.15, in
`abilityMoveMul`). The alpha's kill wears it `CAMP_BUFF_T` (90 s), the dire's bloods the team
`CAMP_BUFF_EPIC_T` (120 s), and a fresh grant only ever extends what is left. It is worn as an
**amber ring of twelve pips around the feet** (`drawBuffRing`, draw-world.js) that loses a pip
at a time as it runs out — the ring is the timer, a full ring on a rival is the warning — and it
goes out with the body on death. There is no HUD element for it: the ring is the read.

**Bots and camps.** A bot fights only a camp that is already hunting it (`aiNearestWolf` answers
a monster whose `target` is that bot, inside `AI_SIGHT`); it will pull a den on its own through
the hunt rung like any other animal, and never the dire wolf (or the alpha below level 6), which
a lone bot would die to. No bot walks *to* a camp deliberately yet — see
[checklists.md](checklists.md#known-drift).

### Birds: the flock (dormant)

The bird kind — `updateBird()`, `flushBirds(L, from)`, `rookeryPerch(L)`, `drawBird`, the
`BIRD_*` constants, `YIELD.bird` — is intact but **nothing spawns one** since the rookery went
with the landmarks ([Known drift](checklists.md#known-drift)). What it was: a flock perched in a
stand's snags, put up all at once by any player inside `BIRD_FLUSH` (34 px), an arrow, or a snag
being chopped; 2.4–4.2 s in the air at `BIRD_SPD` (112 px/s) on a circuit that never leaves the
stand, then back to a perch; `a.alt` (`BIRD_ALT` 15 perched, easing to 26 in flight) the only
height in the game, subtracted by `animalHit` and the cursor, skipped by `separateUnits`; 3 hp on
a 5 px body — the archery range of the map. A camp that wants a flock stands one up with
`props` of `deadTree` and a `spawnOne` that perches birds.

## Economy (one currency)

Every player owns a wallet **and** a bag. `p.inv` is `{ gold }` — currency only, no ceiling —
while everything you *carry* lives in `p.bag`, the slot array described in
[Inventory and the backpack](#inventory-and-the-backpack). (`inv` is an alias for the local
player's wallet.) **Gold is the only resource** — there is no wood or stone —
and berries/fish are consumables ([Food](#food-the-meal-is-a-channel)), never spent on anything. The whole economy is the
`YIELD` table in the constants banner of [js/core.js](../../js/core.js) - the one tuning table
with no single owner - which gives every source a different **yield profile**
rather than a different resource (the League model: one number, many ways to earn it):

| Source | Pays | Profile |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the clock | `TRICKLE_GOLD` (1) every `TRICKLE_T` (4 s) — the `passive income` banner, js/sim.js | 15 a minute to every player on the ground, silently (no floater, no blip); the floor under everyone's purse and the pace a level comes at for a player who never farms |
| tree (`TREE_HP` 3, js/world.js) | `treeFall` 1 on the fell (`treeHit` is 0 — a swing is work, the fell is the pay) | slow, safe, everywhere — a pine a second chained, so a gold a second is the ceiling of full-time farming; leaves a stump, and 1 in 25 leaves a tier-0 [find](#where-tools-and-bits-come-from) |
| dead tree (3 hp) | `deadTreeFall` 1 | a tree, but only in the dire hollow's ring |
| rare tree (8%) | + `treeRare` 3 → 4 | jackpot roll, see `treeRare()` |
| rock (5 hp) | `rockBreak` 3 | better per swing than a pine, back-loaded, and 1 in 5 hides a tier-0 tool or bit |
| rabbit | `rabbit` 2 coins × 5 → 10 (+1 berry) | bolts when approached; jinks one shot per 10 s |
| deer | `deer` 3 coins × 6 → 18 | the big mobile target |
| wolf | `wolf` 3 coins × 8 → 24 | a den's four; neutral until hit, and then the pack bites back |
| alpha | `alpha` 4 coins × 10 → 40 | the stone's one; the kill wears ALPHA'S BLOOD |
| dire wolf | `dire` 6 coins × 15 → 90 | the hollow's one; `EPIC_TEAM_GOLD` (40) to every teammate besides, and the whole team blooded |
| bird | `bird` 2 coins × 4 → 8 | dormant: nothing spawns one |
| generator | `tiers[tier].pay` every `period` s: 1/15, 1/10, 2/12 — 4 / 6 / 10 a minute | passive income, deposited to its owner; sized under the clock's own 15 so a farm of them never out-trickles the trickle |
| chest | `CHEST_GOLD_MIN`–`MAX` (8–20) + a card, and 3 in 4 a **top-tier** tool or bit | ~14 caches along the treeline, one free E press — the only source of the best weapons |

The per-swing rows went to zero and the fells to a coin in 2.63, when a pine paying 5 in
four swings had every bot at the level cap by two minutes: the table is sized so that a
player chaining pines nonstop earns about a gold a second, the trickle is a quarter of that,
and the animals, chests, kills and rocks are where the rest comes from ([hero
levels](multiplayer.md#hero-levels) are sized against the same bot). PACKMULE and the
FORAGER card multiply the fell (`harvestMul`, +25% a level and +50%; the payout rounds), so
a farming build is worth more but can never be the old firehose.

**Gold is never a physical drop.** Every source pays the earner on the spot through
`awardGold(p, n, x, y)` (`players` banner, js/player.js, beside `gainGold` — which it wraps, so
every payout is also XP, see [Hero levels](multiplayer.md#hero-levels)): the `+N` floater rises
at the place the action happened (the tree, the kill, the wreck), and the local earner gets the
coin blip. Who earns is always the actor: the swinger of the blow, the final-blow shooter of an
animal or a loaded worker bot (its `b.carry` goes to whoever downed it), the breaker of an enemy
building (the 50% wreck refund, same as a demolishing owner's), the killer of a player (the
victim's whole wallet — an uncredited death takes its gold down with the body), and a
generator's **owner**, into whose wallet each `pay` tick deposits directly. Robots still carry a
single gold number (`b.carry`) and deposit at 8+ into their owner's wallet.

**Treasure chests** are the free-money exception to earning it: `placeChests()`
([world.md](world.md#treasure-chests)) swaps ~14 inner-edge border trees for chests, and one E
press (`OPEN`, no tool gate) springs one — `CHEST_GOLD_MIN`–`CHEST_GOLD_MAX` gold straight to
the purse plus one unopened card drop rolled from `CHEST_ODDS` (rarity odds beside the other
chest constants in js/world.js). The chest's tile opens with it.

Physical drops still exist for everything **carried**: `spawnDrop(x, y, type, n)` takes the
value of the drop (`d.n`, default 1) and the pickup adds what fits through `bagAdd`, floating
that number in `RES_COLORS[type]`. **Whatever was taken comes off `d.n`, and the drop is only
removed when `d.n` hits zero** — that is what lets a stack of 5 bits half-fill a bag and
leave 3 lying in the snow. A drop's `type` is always an `ITEMS` key now: sources pay `berry` and
the card rarities, a caught fish goes straight into the pouch (taken by `autoFish`, or handed over by a
[fish net](world.md#fish-nets) you are standing on), and death spills — and a wrecked net's
contents — carry `fish` too (`SPRITES.itemFish` in the drop draw pass). Gold, berries and fish all read on
the **hud strip's right end** (bottom centre) — the two meal buttons and the purse tab standing
on the rim over them, on screen whether the pack is open or not. Death empties
wallet, pouch and bag alike —
see [Death and respawn](#death-and-respawn). Drops are neutral: they drift
toward the nearest player, and everyone standing on one contests it
(`canAfford`/`pay` also take the player whose wallet is meant) — except that a player with **no
room** for a drop is neither magnetised by it nor a claimant, so a full bag hands the pickup to
whoever else is standing there instead of sitting on it, and standing alone on something you
cannot carry fires the [refusal tell](#inventory-and-the-backpack) rather than eating it. Food is
outside all of that: the pouch has no ceiling, so a berry is never left in the snow.

## The merchant's counter

**Each eagle's merchant is a shop, and both shops serve everybody.** Walk up to either team's
[merchant](#the-merchant), press **E**, and its counter opens — the **SHOP**: twelve
offers rolled off the tool, bit and card pools, a **sell well** anything in the pack can be
dragged onto, a live **fish and berry market**, and a [restock road](#the-restock-road) counting
down to the next turnover. The whole feature is
[js/shop.js](../../js/shop.js) — the `market`, `the counter's stock`, `buying and selling` and
`the shop panel` banners.

The post is the **shop**; the MARKET is one corner of it, under its own rule on the panel, and it
is the only corner whose prices move. That is why the slab is not itself called a market —
everything above that rule is priced once, on its own def.

Your own roost's merchant is the near one; the rival's is a walk through their base and sells the
same twelve things, because there is **one market and two shopfronts onto it**. That is also why a
merchant **cannot be killed**: `unitAlive` (js/actions.js) answers false for one, which takes it
out of the arrow loop, the roll sweep, every area sweep, a turret's mark, a worker's quarry and
the hunt reticle in a single place — a shop nobody can reach is not a shop. It has no `hp` field
at all and draws no health bar.

### Opening it

`merchNear(p)` is the resolver — the nearest merchant within `SHOP_REACH` (34 px) of a body,
either team's — and the `E SHOP` cap over it (`drawShopHint`, js/ui.js) is the same proximity
prompt the practice armory's `E ARM` uses, drawn only when no [work target](#the-swing-tools-e)
is in reach, exactly as the press is only taken then. The counter is a **panel, not a held wheel**:
the press opens it and E, Escape, the X or **walking out of reach** shuts it (`updateMarket`
re-checks `inReach` every step). It is HUD like the pack and the character sheet — **the sim runs
on underneath, and standing at a counter protects nobody**.

Two things open with it: the **backpack** (`bagOpenNow`), because a sale is a drag out of the
grid; and nothing else — the character sheet closes, since the two slabs would sit on each other.
While it is up, E does not swing at the world (`sampleHumanInput`), the way a wheel already
swallows it.

**The post has its own song.** `openShop` calls `SFX.music.hold('village', …)` — FOREST VILLAGE
LOOP, which loops for exactly as long as the counter is open — and `closeShop` calls
`SFX.music.release()`. A hold notes what was playing **and the second it had reached**, and the
release puts that track back at that second, so a trip to the shop costs the match's own track the
bars it covered rather than the whole song. Any ordinary `music.play`/`music.stop` in between
clears the hold, so a track that takes the layer for its own reason — a victory, the lobby — can
never be undone by a release arriving after it. See the `music` banner, js/audio.js.

The merchant **stands still and faces you** while its counter is open (`shopServing`, read by
`updateMerchant`): it drops the gate, the felling and the loiter for as long as the sale takes.
It is gated on the OPEN PANEL rather than on proximity because everybody lands at the roost
together, and a merchant that stopped for anyone standing near it would never raise its gate.

### The stock, and what it costs

**Every tool, bit and card has a gold price on its own def**: `price` on the `TOOLS` and
`BITS` entries (js/tools.js) and `CARD_PRICE` by rarity (js/player.js). A card is priced by rarity and
not per entry because the rarity is what changes hands — the [pick of three](#roguelike-cards)
inside it is drawn afterwards, so the buyer is paying for the odds.

| section | offers | rolled from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TOOLS | 3 | every key in `TOOLS`, distinct |
| BITS | 3 | the `proj` bits, distinct |
| MODIFIERS | 3 | the `proj: false` bits, distinct |
| CARDS | 3 | `rollCardRarity(SHOP_CARD_ODDS)` — kinder than a chest's `CHEST_ODDS`, since a counter you chose to walk to should beat a box you tripped over |

**An offer is a LINE, not a single item**: it can be bought from as often as gold and bag room
allow until the counter turns over, every `SHOP_RESTOCK` (120 s), announced in the feed, on a
plate under the minimap and over a cue of its own (below), and drawn as a bar draining under the
header. That is what makes the clock matter — what is on the counter
is a *window*, not a queue — and it is also why nothing here is [contested](multiplayer.md#contested-orders):
two players at one counter cannot take the same thing from each other.

Everything rolls on `mktRng`, the market's **own** stream seeded off `SEED` (the chests' `chRng`
pattern): the same seed is the same market on every machine, and a busy shop can never shift a loot
roll by consuming draws out of the shared stream.

**Buying** goes through `input.cmd = { kind: 'shop', … }` → `runCmd` → `shopBuy`, the path
[gear](#gear) already uses, so a bot could buy tomorrow without a second code path; it re-validates
its own reach the way `buyGear` re-validates its cost, and it checks **bag room before it takes
the money**, so nothing is ever paid for that cannot be carried. Bots do not shop yet.

**Selling** is a **drag**: pick a cell out of the grid and let go over the sell well
(`shopDropSell`, reached from `dragDrop`). The whole cell goes — an instanced tool cannot be
split — and **a loaded tool sells with its bits**, at half of each, so nothing is ever quietly
emptied for gold (`cellValue` → `sellValue`). Made goods fetch **half** their asking price; that
margin is the whole reason looting still beats shopping. Unlike the buys, a sale resolves on the
spot rather than through `input.cmd`: what is on the cursor is out of the bag already, and a
command the sim might drop that frame (pause, the chart) would take the item with it.

**A sale pays gold but no XP** — `tradeGold`, the one documented exception to the `gainGold`
rule in [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md). A trade is an exchange, not a source: the counter buys food
at the price it sells it, so paying levels for a sale would turn two clicks into a level farm.

### The fish and berry market

**Fish and berries have a price that moves, and they are the only two things in the game that do.**
`GOODS` (js/shop.js) is the whole table: `base` is what a thing is worth when nothing is
happening, `min`/`max` are rails it can never leave, `vol` is the ordinary step and `shock`
the chance a step is a **lurch** instead — straight to `lo` or `hi` of where it stood.

| good | base | rails | ordinary step | lurch |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FISH | 18 | 5–60 | ±13% | 5% of steps, ×0.62 or ×1.7 |
| BERRIES | 4 | 1–15 | ±11% | 4% of steps, ×0.66 or ×1.6 |

Fish are the money good and berries the small change — a fish is worth four or five berries at
rest and the gap widens on a spike, so a pouch of fish is a real decision about *when* to sell
it. Every `MKT_STEP` (5 s) each good takes one step: a pull `MKT_REVERT` of the way back to its
base, the drift, then the lurch. `price` is a float and the walk runs on it; what is ever **paid**
is `marketPrice()`, the rounded coin, so the graph can wander between two whole numbers without
the counter's price flickering.

**Both goods trade at one price in both directions** — no spread at all, the one place the
half-price rule does not apply. A spread would kill the only thing the market is *for* (buy low,
hold, sell high), and there is nothing to protect: the price does the taking by itself.

**The graphs are three days deep.** Each good keeps `MKT_HIST` samples (`MKT_DAYS × CYCLE ÷
MKT_STEP` = 99, one per step), drawn as a filled sparkline with a dotted gridline per day boundary
and its high and low printed small at the ends. `initMarket()` **primes the whole history at
boot** by walking it forward from the base price, so the counter's graphs are graphs on day one
rather than a flat line that fills in over the first quarter of an hour.

**A big move makes the news.** `marketNews` cuts a headline when the price has moved both
`MKT_NEWS` (30%) *and* the good's own `news` gold since the last one — green on a rise and red on
a fall. The absolute floor is the half that matters: a berry going 2G → 3G is a 50% "spike", and
without it the feed fills with small change. The card that made one pulses in the panel for three
seconds.

A headline goes to **two places at once**, and a restock's does too:

- the **event feed**, bottom-left — `FISH SPIKE 34G`, `BERRIES CRASH 2G`, `THE MERCHANTS RESTOCK`
  — the match's own record, where everything else that happened to somebody already is;
- a **plate top-right under the minimap** — the `market notices` banner in js/shop.js, drawn by
  `renderNotices` ([the plates](rendering.md#market-notices-the-plates-under-the-minimap)) —
  because a price is not something that happened to a player: it is the state of the world you are
  about to sell your bag into, and it has to arrive where the clock and the alive count are
  rather than in a log at the far corner.

Both readouts take their colour from one table (`NOTE_KIND`), handed straight to `logEvent` as its
palette override, so the two can never disagree about which way a price went.

**Each has its own cue** (js/audio.js): `SFX.market(up)` is a coin dinging on a spike and a falling
sigh on a crash — two *different* clips rather than one pitched two ways, and unjittered, because
this is read as a direction and never as a texture — and `SFX.restock()` is the turnover in two beats, a
wagon pulling in and, `RESTOCK_RING` (0.9 s) behind it, the bell over the new stock. Neither is
gated on standing at a counter any more: a turnover is the one market event worth walking across
the map for, and news you only hear once you are already there is not news.

### The panel

It is **wide and short and pinned near the top edge** rather than centred, and that is the one
piece of the layout that is not taste: the [tooltip](rendering.md#the-hover-tooltip) is bottom-left and grows
upward off the bottom rim, so a tall centred slab would put its own bottom-left corner exactly
where a tall tooltip lands — hovering the last row of offers would hide the last row of offers.
Its **height** is spent against that same rule. The deepest tooltip an offer here can raise tops
out around 192 px on the 270-row frame the slab is authored in (it centres in the 640×360 view), and the order along the bottom of the
336×216 slab is chosen against that line: the **sell strip ends at 190**, clear of it, and only
the restock road below runs under it — the road, whose countdown sits at its **right** end where
no tooltip reaches. So all a tooltip can ever cover is the wagon, briefly, while you are reading a
tool — never an offer, a card, the sell target or the clock.
The pack, the hud strip and the feed all stay readable underneath while you trade. (On the
shortest view the canvas allows, 350×240, the slab covers the pack, as the narrower one before it
did; every ordinary view clears it.)

Top to bottom: the **awning** — a snow-capped, icicled valance striped in the counter's own team
colours, the one thing on the panel that says whose eagle this is — with the shop's sign hung off
its hem between two lanterns, the merchant's portrait framed at one end and the purse at the
other; the four sections as a 2×2 grid of three-well rows, each on a recessed
board; the **MARKET** rule and its two cards side by side; the **SELL strip**, the full width of
the slab, with air under it now rather than sitting on the rail; and the
[restock road](#the-restock-road) along that rail. The frame, the section rules, the market cards and
that edge are all cut from one timber palette under iron corner brackets, which is what makes the
slab read as a shopfront rather than as one more blue HUD panel.

Every offer well wears **its item's own tier plate** (`tierPlate`, gilded ones still shine) with
the price on a band along the bottom. Two rules make the twelve read as one grid rather than as
twelve loose pictures: every icon is drawn at the largest **whole-number** scale that fits
`SHOP_ICON` (16) px (`shopIconCv`, baked once each) — the game's two icon grids are 8×8 and 12×12,
so the counter runs 16s with the three tools at 12, rather than the tool with twice the *area* of
the bit beside it that it looked like before the rule existed. The scale has to be whole: a
fractional one stretches every third source pixel to double width, and a bow's 1 px linework comes
out frayed. A common size for both grids needs 24, which is bigger than this counter wants its
goods to be. And a price band's coin sits at a **fixed** offset with its number **right-aligned** to
another, so a section's three prices line up as a column instead of three centred groups sliding
about with the digit count.

### The restock road

Along the bottom rail, under the sell strip: **how long until the twelve offers above it turn
over** (`drawShopLane`, the `the restock road` banner). It replaced a 2 px bar under the sign,
which was honest about the *shape* of the thing — a countdown is a length — and useless about the
only question actually asked of it: long enough to go and earn more gold, or worth waiting here
for?

So it answers twice, and neither answer is a sentence. **The number** is on a plate at the road's
far end, `M:SS` beside a small clock face, going gold and flashing under 15 s. **The picture** is
the merchant's own errand: a canopied wagon and the horse in its shafts leave the post's door at
the turnover, are furthest out at the halfway mark, and roll back through that door exactly as the
new stock lands. The wagon's **position is the clock** — there is no separate progress bar,
because the wagon already is one — it faces the way it is going, and its trot frame is cut from
**distance travelled** rather than from a timer of its own, so the legs and the wheels belong to
the same journey.

The countdown sits at the **right** end deliberately: the [tooltip](rendering.md#the-hover-tooltip)
grows up out of the bottom-**left** corner, so that is the one readout here that has to survive
being read at the same time as an offer.

**A price you cannot pay is said three ways at once**, because one was too quiet to catch at a
glance: the well's rim and its price band both go to the counter's out-of-reach red
(`SHOP_DEAR_*`), the price ink with them, and the goods themselves grey back under a wash — the
tier plate keeping its own hue through it, since which tier a thing is stays true whatever it
costs. It does not lift under the pointer and it does not shine. It is the same red
[tipGear](#gear)'s next-level row and the pack's own refusal already speak, and a market card's
BUY plate wears it too when the reason it is dead is the price rather than a full pack.

The one control here that is not a click is the one with a **word** on it: you arrive at the sell
strip already holding something, so it says SELL rather than trusting a glyph to carry a verb, and
it is a full-width recessed well with corner brackets because a drop target you are aiming at with
an item on the cursor should be hard to miss. Idle it is SELL → a coin; with something in hand it
becomes that item → a coin and the gold it fetches, and the whole well lights and pulses. At rest
a slow band of light crosses it (`sellSheen`) — the counter is open for business, and the one
control you arrive at *holding* something has to look live while nothing is happening to it. It is
a long period and a soft envelope on purpose: this is the panel's resting state, and a resting
state must not blink. Nothing
else on the panel is labelled with a verb: a market card's two trade plates say their direction by
*arrangement* — coin into item is a buy, item into coin is a sale — and the price is stated once,
big, because it is the same number both ways. The
section headings (TOOLS / BITS / MODIFIERS / CARDS) and the graphs' own numbers are this panel's
share of [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)'s carve-out, for the reason the practice instruments have
one: reading a market **is** reading numbers, and no shape compares a price today against a price
yesterday. Hovering anything on it describes it in the ordinary tooltip — an offer with a PRICE
row on top of the rows that item shows anywhere else, a good with its day's change and its
three-day high and low — and while the counter is up, every bag cell's tooltip gains a SELLS FOR
row.

## Inventory and the backpack

A player carries in two places, and which one a kind lives in is **one flag on its `ITEMS` row**.

**The bag** (`p.bag`) is a fixed array of `p.bagCap` cells, each one `null`
or a `{ type, n }` stack of at most `ITEMS[type].stack`. Everyone starts with **one bag of 10**
(`BAG_CAP`, two rows of `BAG_COLS` — a simple inventory); a second bag is a bigger `bagCap` and a longer array,
nothing else. It holds the **build**: the tools, bits and unopened cards a player lays out,
compares and chooses between.

**The pouch** (`p.food`) is a pair of uncapped counters beside the wallet, and it holds the two
**meals** — everything with `pouch: true`. Food takes no cell, cannot be dragged, cannot be
arranged and cannot be refused: it is pressed on Q and F from
[the hud strip's meal buttons](rendering.md#the-hud-strip) and nowhere else, so every cell one of
them used to take was a cell taken off the build. Being uncapped is why every count that shows
one goes through **`shortNum`** (js/core.js) — `999`, then `1.2K`, `12K`, `340K`, `1.2M`, four
characters at most. The exact figure stays in the tooltip, the surface whose job is comparing
numbers.

| Item | Icon | Where | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `berry` | `itemBerry` | pouch, no cap | Q, or clicking the strip's meal button — eats it (see [Food](#food-the-meal-is-a-channel)) |
| `fish` | `itemFish` | pouch, no cap | F, or clicking its meal button — eats it (same) |
| `cardWhite`/`cardGreen`/`cardBlue`/`cardPurple`/`cardGold` | `itemCard<Rarity>` | bag, stack 5 | clicking its cell — opens the pick-1-of-3 draft (see [Roguelike cards](#roguelike-cards)) |
| `tool:<id>` | `toolArt_<shape>_<tier>` | bag, stack 1 | dragged onto one of the four weapon slots (see [Tools and bits](#tools-and-bits)) |
| `bit:<id>` | `bitArt_<id>` | bag, stack 4 | loads itself into the tool in hand on pickup (`fitAdd`), or is dragged into a cell of the shelf |

An unopened card is a completely ordinary `ITEMS` entry — one per rarity, since a stack has to be
homogeneous and a white card and a gold card are not interchangeable — which is what makes bag
storage, the drop pickup, the refusal flash and death-spill (see
[Death and respawn](#death-and-respawn)) all free for it, same as any other carried item. Tools and bits
register their rows the same way, from [js/tools.js](../../js/tools.js), under namespaced keys so
a kind can never collide with a berry.

A tool is the **one instanced** item: its cell carries the bits loaded into it, so it stacks to 1
and moves as a whole object (`bagPut(p, cell)`, and `spawnDrop`'s `it` payload) rather than being
rebuilt from `s.type`. `bagAdd` cannot make one and must not be asked to — the drop pickup
branches on `d.it` for exactly this reason. Everything else in the bag is stateless.

**The slot is the unit of capacity for what the bag holds**, which is the whole reason it is an
array and not a row of counters: two half stacks cost two cells, so a bag genuinely fills and the
pickup path can genuinely refuse. Six helpers in the `players` banner are the entire API —
`bagCount(p, type)`,
`bagUsed(p)`, `bagRoom(p, type)` (room in partial stacks + a full stack per empty cell),
`bagAdd(p, type, n)` (tops up partial stacks before opening a cell, returns how many went in),
`bagTake(p, type, n)` (spends from the **last** stack backwards, so partials empty and free their
cell) and `bagPut(p, cell)` (an instanced cell into the first free slot, or false). Nothing outside
them touches `p.bag` — `updateEat` (the meal landing), the fish catch, the drop pickup, the AI's food check
and `spillInventory` all go through the six. The one deliberate exception is the **drag**
([UI banner](../../js/ui.js)), which is moving cells between wells rather than storing items, and
owns `p.bag[i]` directly for exactly the length of one gesture.

**The four counting helpers are also where the pouch lives** (`isPouch(type)`): for a `pouch` kind
`bagCount` reads `p.food[type]`, `bagRoom` answers `Infinity`, `bagAdd` always takes it all and
`bagTake` spends it. That one branch is what keeps every caller generic over where a kind actually
sits — the drop pickup, the catch, a market trade, the AI's food check and the death spill are
written once and neither know nor care.

**Refusing is a real outcome** for what the *bag* holds, and every path that cannot store
something says so the same way:
`bagDenied()` reddens and shakes the whole backpack frame for 0.6 s with one `SFX.deny()`, and re-firing while
it is already up does nothing, so standing on a drop you cannot carry is one flash and not sixty a
second. Food is the one thing that can never fire it: a berry, a catch and a bought fish go into
the pouch whatever the bag is holding. The **weapon** refuses in the same language:
`toolDenied()` / `toolFlash` (UI › `hud strip`) bands the weapon well in that red and shakes it
for the same 0.6 s when a bit has nowhere to go in it, so the container that is full is always
the one that answers.

The HUD is in the `UI` › `backpack` banner — see
[the backpack](rendering.md#the-backpack).

## Food: the meal is a channel

Berries and fish are the only heal a player carries, and they answer the same question — *can I take
this fight* — so the whole thing is **one clock and one channel**, in the `food` banner of
[js/core.js](../../js/core.js):

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `FOOD_CD` | **3 s**, and it is **shared**: eating either meal puts *both* away |
| `FOOD_EAT` | **1.5 s** of channel, interruptible for its whole length |
| `FOOD_SLOW` | **×0.5** on the walk cap and the ice cap while chewing — the drag a cast puts on the legs |
| `ITEMS[type].heal` | what the meal is worth before `foodMul`: berry **20**, fish **50** |

**Nothing is spent up front.** `startEat(p, type)` only arms `p.eatT`/`p.eatType`; the food leaves
the pouch and `p.foodCd` starts when `updateEat` lands the channel — exactly the way an ability's
cooldown starts when its *cast* lands, not when the key is pressed
([Class abilities](#class-abilities-keys-1-4)). So a meal knocked out of your hands costs the time
and the tempo and **nothing out of the pouch**, and can be restarted on the spot.

`eatBerry(p)` / `eatFish(p)` are still the two edge-triggered intents Q and F set (two keys, two
meals — the hud strip's meal buttons click the same intents a key sets); both are one
line into `startEat`. It refuses — with the `SFX.deny()` an ability well
speaks — while the clock is up, the body is busy (stunned, falling, rolling, mid-cast, mid-rush,
airborne), or there is nothing a meal could do (no food, or already at full hp).

**What breaks a meal** is `breakEat(p)`, and every side that can break one calls it. The world
takes it away: a hit (`damagePlayer`), a stun (`stunUnit`), the ice (the hole plunge in
`updatePlayer`), death (`die`, `practiceRevive`). And **you** drop it on purpose, two ways — a
**dodge roll** (`tryDodge`), and the **fire button**: the rising edge of `inp.fire` in
`updatePlayer` cancels the meal and the draw gate two lines below arms in the *same frame*, so a
body mid-chew is never a body that cannot fight back. The food is unspent, so the cancel costs the
1.5 s and the tempo and nothing else, and the meal can be started again the moment the shot is
away.

**What a meal still refuses** is the E swing (`tryWork`) and an ability (`tryAbility`) — the two
presses that spend a cooldown, which a stray keypress should not be able to throw away. A meal does
*not* break the burrow — you can eat lying in the snow — and its crumbs fade with the cover exactly
as the overhead tells do (`alpha: 1 - concealOf(p)`).

**It reads without a word of it** ([UI rule](../../CLAUDE.md#ui-rule-show-dont-label)):

- the **overhead frame** carries the channel in the same slot as the bow-draw meter, filled in the
  heal green — gold = drawing, slate = reloading, **green = eating** — so a rival can see the meal
  and take it away ([Overhead health bars](rendering.md#overhead-health-bars));
- crumbs in the meal's own colour fly at the mouth for the whole channel;
- the shared clock **wipes top-down over the food itself** (`drawFoodClock`, UI › `backpack`) — in
  the bag cell the click that eats lands on, on the open pack's strip counters *and* on the hud
  strip's two **meal buttons** (`drawFoodCell`, [rendering.md](rendering.md#the-hud-strip) — icon,
  count, key letter, and a click that sets the same `eatBerry`/`eatFish` intent the key does).
  All wipe together: that is the point of one clock. The meal being chewed lights its own well
  white, the way a casting ability well does.
- the food tooltip carries `HEALS` / `EAT` / `COOLDOWN` / `CARRIED` and a red `READY IN` while the
  clock runs — the same rows `tipClassAb` prints.

**Bots eat through the same one path** (`updateAI` rung 1, which is why it reads `foe` before the
burrow rung): a bot only starts a meal with no rival inside `AI_EAT_R` (110 px), because standing
there chewing under fire is not patience, it is a free kill.

## Gear

Every player wears four pieces — **helmet, chest, legs, boots** (`GEAR_SLOTS`) — each one of three
variants with a distinct lane, all in the `GEAR` table in the `players` banner:

| Slot | Variants (per piece level) |
| --- | --- |
| helmet | LONGSIGHT +1 arrow dmg · QUICKDRAW −8% draw *and* renock time · HUNTSMAN +15% animal-kill gold |
| chest | BULWARK +8 max hp · IRONHIDE −1 dmg from every hit (min 1) · HEARTHWEAVE +25% food heal, passive heal runs at night |
| legs | STRIDER +4% walk speed · SLIDEWORN −12% fatigue, slide engages 5 sooner · PACKMULE +1 gold on fells/breaks |
| boots | SKATES +8% ice cap, +0.15 steer · DANCER −0.4 s dodge refill · GHOSTSTEP wolves/turrets acquire at −10% range |

The variant pick is free and is **level 1**; in-match gold buys each piece to level `GEAR_LV_MAX`
(4) for `GEAR_COSTS` 10/20/35 — the second gold sink beside building. Levels reset with the match
(every boot builds fresh `Player`s). The human picks variants in the **gear pop-up** — opened
from class select's collapsed gear widget, all 12 variants at once as 32×32 icon wells beside a
live preview and a real-number stat ledger with hover deltas (League runes-style; see
[Main menu](rendering.md#main-menu-title)); `pickGear()` writes straight to `player.gear`. AI
players hash all four variants from the seed in `initPlayers()`. **Every variant has its own
icons**: the 12×12 material-swapped `SPRITES.gearIcons[slot][variant][material]` the HUD and
the select screen's plaque wear, and the detailed 32×32 `GEAR32` set the pop-up's wells wear —
a pick is a distinct picture, not a label.

**Worn gear shows on the sprite**: each piece at level 2+ lays a 1 px band of its material across
the shared 16×16 body plan — hat, coat, hips, one mark per foot (`GEAR_MARKS`/`drawGearMarks`,
called from `drawPlayer` under the held tool; skipped while rolling, in a hole, or in title). The
free level-1 pick draws nothing, so the baseline look stays the class's; a fed player reads
iron → steel → gold at a glance, the same materials the HUD plates wear.

**Mechanism**: a variant's `mod(k, L)` writes its bonus into the player's *effective kit* —
`refreshKit(p)` copies the class kit, adds the gear-only defaults (`huntMul`, `dr`, `foodMul`,
`nightHeal`, `walkMul`, `harvestMul`, `dodgeCd`, `stealth`) and applies the four mods; `kitOf(p)`
returns that cache, so every existing kit read site (movement, `emitBit`, dodge timing, the AI,
the draw meter) picks gear up without knowing it exists. The sim never reads `p.gear` directly.
Sites that read the gear-only fields: `damagePlayer` (`dr`), `updateEat`'s landing and the daylight
regen (`foodMul`/`nightHeal`), `hitObject`'s fell/break payouts (`harvestMul`), `animalDies`
(`huntMul`, paid to `a.lastHit` — stamped by the arrow loop — as one extra coin), **`seenAt()`**
(`stealth` — see [Prone](#prone-under-the-snow); the wolf pack, both turret checks *and*
`aiNearestEnemy` all go through it now, so GHOSTSTEP finally does something against another
player instead of only against wolves and turrets), and the three dodge-refill sites (`dodgeCd`).

**Buying** goes through `input.cmd = {kind:'gear', piece}` → `runCmd` → `buyGear(p, i)` — the one
entry point: it re-validates cost, pays, bumps `gearLv`, rebuilds the kit, and heals a BULWARK
bump on the spot like a hero level. No tile, no reach, no contest — it only touches the buyer's
own wallet. The human buys on the **character panel** (G): the four pieces sit head-to-toe as
32 px icon wells (`charLayout`/`charHit`/`drawCharPanel`, UI banner), each named in the material
of its level (leather → iron → steel → gold) with gear's three buy pips and the next level's
price on it — an affordable well pulses its rim gold, a click on it buys, and a maxed piece goes
quiet behind a gold rim
([the character panel](rendering.md#the-character-panel-g)). There is no keyboard shortcut for
it: keys 1-4 are the class abilities, and gear is bought where gear is worn. `gearHit` (now a
read through `charHit`) is still shared by the click handler, `cursorInfo` (hand cursor) and
`tipAt`, so the three can never disagree. The click is swallowed **before** `clickAction` — the
panel, the backpack widget, the hud strip (the weapon well, an ability well casting and its buy
badge) and the weapon shelf are the left-clickable HUD in play. Bots buy in `updateAI`'s
spend step: cheapest piece first, keeping a 15-gold float so they still build.

## Roguelike cards

A permanent buff dropped by a sprung **chest** in the treeline (`placeChests`, js/world.js;
`hitObject`'s chest branch in js/actions.js rolls the rarity against `CHEST_ODDS` through
`rollCardRarity`), one at a time, one draft at a time.
`CARDS` is `{ white: [...], green: [...], blue: [...], purple: [...], gold: [...] }`
(`CARD_RARITIES`, White → Gold rising in rarity and magnitude), each entry `{ name, blurb, mod(k) }` —
the exact shape a `GEAR` variant's `mod(k, L)` is, minus the level argument, since a card is a
one-shot pick rather than a leveled buy. Every effect stays inside `kitOf`'s existing field
vocabulary (`dmgBase`, `dr`, `maxHp`, `walkMul`, `stealth`, `ambushMul`, `iceMax`, …) except one
genuinely new field, `killHeal` — a flat heal on a confirmed kill, hooked at `die()`'s existing
kill-credit line the same way `updateEat` applies a meal's.

**The draft**: clicking an unopened card's bag cell (`bagClick`) calls `openDraft(rarity)`, which sets `state.draft = { rarity, options }` — three distinct
entries drawn at random from `CARDS[rarity]` (`pick3Distinct`). `renderDraft`/`draftLayout`/
`draftHit` draw and hit-test three cards centred on screen, but as an in-match overlay like
the bag or the map — **it does not pause the sim**, same as every other HUD overlay here, so a
draft is read at real risk, not in a safe pause. `draftClick()` (the mousedown handler routes to it
first, ahead of the wheel/settings/map/bag, whenever `state.draft` is set) either applies the
clicked card — `bagTake` the one card, push `{ rarity, id }` onto `p.cards`, `refreshKit(p)` — or,
for a click anywhere else (or ESC), just closes the draft; either way the click never reaches the
world underneath. `refreshKit` folds every entry in `p.cards` in after gear and skill, cumulatively
(`for (const c of p.cards) CARDS[c.rarity][c.id].mod(k);`), so picking the same effect twice stacks
it, and every existing kit-reading site in the sim — movement, `emitBit`, dodge timing, the AI,
`seenAt`'s stealth — picks a card up for free, the same way it already does for gear. `p.cards` is
set once in the `Player` constructor and never touched by `reset()`, so a build survives every
respawn within a match.

**Bots never see the draft** — `bagClick` is a mouse-only entry point `updateAI` never calls.
Instead, the instant a bot is carrying any unopened card, `resolveCardForBot(p)` resolves it
server-side with one random pick from that rarity's pool — no 3-option UI, since choosing among
three is specifically the human decision point.

## Base building

Right-clicking a **stump** within 60 px opens a radial **build wheel** anchored at the stump's
screen position (clamped to stay on-screen), four even wedges: wall, turret, generator, bot
bay (`STRUCT_ORDER`, type `spawner`) — `wheelSpan(n)`/
`wheelAng(i, n)` re-derive n even wedges from `STRUCT_ORDER.length` alone, so an entry comes and
goes with no layout code (the Keep's did), only the option itself; push out of the hub and release over a wedge to build,
release inside the hub to cancel.

**The site picks the menu.** `buildSiteAt(tx, ty)` answers `'land'` for a stump, `'water'` for a
bare open ice hole, and `null` otherwise — and the input handler, the cursor's hammer, the
selection brackets and `wheelOptions()` all ask that one function, so none of them can offer a site
another refuses. A water site lists `WATER_STRUCT_ORDER`, which is just the
[fish net](world.md#fish-nets); nothing is special-cased for a single option, because
`wheelSpan(1)` is the whole circle and the hub still cancels.

Right-clicking a **finished** structure (any tile of it) opens a
**manage wheel**: upgrade straight up, demolish last, and — unlike the build wheel — this list
*isn't* generic over `STRUCT_ORDER` (`wheelOptions()` hand-builds it), so a type's own extra
order would go between the two — the Keep's card craft did, and the bay's old gather/guard toggle
did before its crew went under the [worker flag](#worker-flags); today no type has one. This wheel is the **only** way to
build — there are no free-placed buildables. All the data lives in the `STRUCTS` table: three
tiers for wall/turret/generator (the wood → stone → gold *look* is just the sprite
palette) and **one each for the bay and the net**, each with a gold `cost`, `hp`, `buildT`, and
per-type stats. A `water: true` entry (only the net) goes on a hole instead of a stump, and that
flag — never the type name — is what `placeStruct`, `isSolidTile` and the dawn refreeze each read;
see [Fish nets](world.md#fish-nets).
`tiers[0]` is what the wheel builds; upgrading pays the next tier's cost and re-runs a shorter
construction, and the last tier (`tiers.length - 1`) reports MAX TIER. Building and [gear](#gear)
are the two gold sinks.

Mechanics (the wheel in [ui.js](../../js/ui.js), the buildings in [structures.js](../../js/structures.js)):

- `state.wheel` (`{kind:'build'|'manage'|'rack'|'pkdie'|'agbell', tx, ty, seg, ax, ay}`) is the open wheel —
  `'rack'` is the practice armory, `'pkdie'` the parkour roll die and `'agbell'` the archery
  range's bell, all three opened by holding **E**
  beside them and resolved on its release
  ([world.md](world.md#the-practice-arena)); ESC/M/settings/death
  close it, a left-click cancels it, and the game **keeps running** — opening the
  wheel mid-night is deliberate pressure. `wheelLayout()` is shared by `resolveWheel()` and
  `renderWheel()` so hover math and pixels can never disagree. `resolveWheel()` does not act: it
  writes `player.input.cmd`, and `runCmd(p, c)` performs it in the next sim step (re-checking
  ownership and the 60 px reach).
- **One geometry, any number of options.** `wheelSpan(n)` is `2*PI/n` and `wheelAng(i, n)` is
  `-PI/2 + i * span`: n wedges of exactly the same size, the first centred straight up and the
  rest clockwise. Nothing is special-cased per count — 4 options land on up/right/down/left and 2
  on up/down because that is what the formula gives, and 3 land 120° apart. The hover test reads
  the segment with the *same* `floor((angle + span/2) / span)` the wedges are drawn from, so a
  wedge is exactly its own hitbox at any count. `wheelOptions()` returns ids only; `wheelLayout()`
  stamps the angle on each, so there is one source for the layout.
- **Radii** (all in the `radial wheel` banner): `WHEEL_HUB` 13 is the hole in the middle,
  `WHEEL_R` 40 the rim, `WHEEL_PAD` 4 the backing disc beyond it, and `WHEEL_RING` — the midpoint
  of the band — is where every icon and label sits, so they are the same distance from the centre
  in every direction. Wedges are drawn as annulus sectors (arc out at `WHEEL_R`, arc back at
  `WHEEL_HUB`) with a `WHEEL_GAP` of daylight between them, measured in px at the rim so the gap
  looks the same however many wedges there are.
- **The hub is the cancel target.** It carries a cross rather than the word CANCEL, and goes hot
  red while the pointer is inside it — which is where the pointer starts, so the way out is the way
  you came in. `WHEEL_HUB` is also the deadzone: nothing is chosen until the pointer travels 13 px,
  which makes a plain right-click (press and release without moving) a no-op. ESC and a left-click
  both close the wheel outright, and the left-click also stops the right-release that follows from
  firing the order.
- **The pointer is measured from `ax`/`ay`, the point the right button went down at**, not from
  the wheel's drawn hub: that press is what the hand remembers, and the hub is pinned to the tile,
  so it drifts as the camera follows the player and gets clamped near a screen edge. Because that
  travel is invisible (the cursor can be anywhere on screen), `drawWheelStick()` draws it at the
  hub as a knob that moves **1:1** with the pointer — so the knob is visibly inside the lit wedge —
  clamped to the lane between the hub rim and the icon ring so it never lands on an icon. Grey on
  the cross means nothing is chosen; gold out in a wedge means that is what a release will do.
- `placeStruct(tx, ty, type, p)` consumes the stump (the tile is **empty** after demolition —
  stumps are a finite site resource), pays `tiers[0].cost` from that player's wallet, and has
  `createStruct()` drop the object into `building` state at 30% hp, stamped with `owner`/`team`
  (`createStruct` is the one constructor — `DBG.buildStruct` uses it too — and lays the `part`
  fillers for a big footprint). It enforces the 60 px reach
  and the don't-entomb-yourself AABB check, and the placement itself is
  [contested](multiplayer.md#contested-orders) so two players can't claim one stump.
- **The bay needs room**: `findSite(type, tx, ty)` tries every 3×2 anchor that covers the clicked
  stump and takes the one covering the most stumps, where every tile is in-world snow holding
  nothing or a stump and no player stands inside it; none → "NO ROOM" and the order is denied (the
  AI only orders a bay where `findSite` succeeds). The anchor is the top-left tile.
- **Ownership**: a building wears its team's palette (`structSprite`), and `ownsStruct(o, p)`
  means only its side can open the manage wheel, upgrade or demolish it. Stumps are neutral.
- **Construction**: `updateStructures()` (called from `updatePlay`, iterating only the
  `structures` registry) advances `buildT`, grows hp toward max, and puffs dust; the draws pass
  shows `SPRITES.scaffold[0|1]` under 2/3 progress, then the real sprite under the `scaffold[2]`
  lattice. A sprite wider than 16 px — the bay — builds differently: the first 12% of the timer
  shows only a staked-out foundation pad over the footprint, then the sprite rises bottom-up behind
  a weld line that throws sparks from `updateStructures` (`bigBuildReveal()` is the shared split so
  the sparks sit on the drawn edge), and completion flashes the sprite white (`o.flash`), puffs
  snow along the roofline and shakes harder. Small builds keep their burst + `SFX.place` + shake. A
  yellow progress bar renders above every site (centred over the roof for a big one). Sites are
  solid from placement. A big building y-sorts by the bottom of its footprint and sits its snow
  skirt on that edge.
- **Turret**: picks the nearest enemy player or worker bot inside `tiers[tier].range`, swings the
  gun onto it at `traverse` rad/s (2.2 / 3.0 / 3.8 — it never snaps), and once the bearing is
  inside `TUR_LOCK` (0.14 rad) charges for `aim` seconds (0.55 / 0.45 / 0.35) before firing a
  **bolt** every `rate` seconds. Losing the bearing bleeds the charge back down rather than
  cancelling it. Targeting runs through `turretMark`/`turretHolds`, which reject anything on the
  turret's own team, anything dead, and any player still `inAir` on the eagle; `turretSees` walks
  tiles from the pivot and holds fire when a solid tile blocks the shot, skipping the turret's own
  footprint (the pivot sits above the tile, so the first samples fall back inside the mount). With
  no mark it sweeps ±1.15 rad at a third of its traverse, so a live turret never reads as a prop.
  A bolt is an ordinary entry in `arrows` tagged `kind: 'bolt'`, so it inherits arrow collision,
  friendly fire and kill credit for free — it just draws differently and flies at `BOLT_SPD` (250).
  `fireBolt` walks the spawn point out of the turret's own footprint first: turrets are solid
  tiles and bolts die on solid tiles, so a depressed barrel would otherwise shoot itself.
  **Generator**: deposits `tiers[tier].pay` gold every `period` seconds straight into its
  **owner's** wallet (`awardGold` — the `+N` floater rises at the generator, but there is
  nothing to collect and no pile to cap). **Bot bay** (`spawner`):
  keeps `tiers[0].bots` (3) robots alive, rolling them out **one at a time** — the first 1 s after
  completion, then 4 s apart; a lost bot takes 12 s to replace (`respawnT`/`respawnTotal`).
  `makeRobot` spawns at `structMouth()` (the ring around the footprint if that is blocked) with an
  exhaust puff. **Barracks** (`barracks`): the wave bay, **never on the wheel** — not in
  `STRUCT_ORDER`; each [merchant](#the-merchant) raises one in the woods behind its roost, and
  `fixed: true` refuses the manage wheel's upgrade and demolish, so nobody pulls it down for the
  refund. It wears the bay's 3×2 grid (`art: 'spawner'`, read by `structSprite`) under its own
  overlay (`drawBarracksOverlay`: the shutter, the next soldier sliding down the door, the wave
  clock on the flank in the side's paint, the beacon amber while a column is leaving). Every
  `waveT` (30 s) it queues a **wave** — `wave` (5) soldiers, one more per `grow` (180 s) it has
  stood, never more than `cap` (24) of its soldiers alive at once — and the queue leaves the door
  one every `BARRACKS_ROLL` (0.5 s), so a wave reads as a column. Its `cost` (40) is only what a
  wrecker is paid half of: breaking one stalls the waves until the merchant rebuilds it
  ([Soldiers](#soldiers-the-waves)). `drawBayOverlay()` draws everything live on top of the baked sprite: the next bot
  sliding down the doorway over the last 0.8 s of its timer; a roll-up **shutter** over the doorway
  (`o.door`, lerped in the tick — open while any of its workers is out of the yard or one is
  rolling out, shut when the whole crew is home, so the door reports the bay's state rather than
  a mode nobody sets any more);
  three **bot pips** on the right flank (lit = alive, blinking = being built, dark = empty) with the
  roll-out timer as a bar under them; a flickering slat across each vent grille; a roof **beacon**
  that blinks amber while a bot is due; and an hp bar over the roof once damaged. `removeStruct()`
  clears the whole footprint and kills its robots with it.
- **Buildings take damage from E, but only from the other team.** `hitObject()`'s structure
  branch deals `STRUCT_HIT_DMG` (10) a swing, at the `swingCd` of 0.34 s — so ~2 s for a tier-1
  wall (60 hp), ~10 s for a tier-3 one (300 hp), ~7.5 s for the bay (220 hp). It flashes and
  shakes the building like any other struck object, floats the damage, and shakes the camera for
  the local player. Damage is **contested** with everything else E does, since it runs inside
  `swingHit`'s `contest('work:' + idx)`. At 0 hp it calls `destroyStructure(o, true, p)` — the
  wreck pays out exactly like a demolition, straight to the wrecker — and
  logs `<NAME> WRECKED A <TYPE>` to the event feed. Nothing else damages a building: arrows die
  on solid tiles without hurting them, and no AI or wildlife targets one.
- Demolish refunds **50% of the cumulative cost across tiers** (`cumulativeCost`), paid to the
  demolisher on the spot through `awardGold` — 23 gold for a fully-upgraded wall. `demolishStruct()` →
  `destroyStructure(o, true, p)` is the live path for that, reached from `runCmd` for the wheel's
  demolish order. `canAfford`/`pay`/`costText` are generic over every `inv` key. Demolishing is
  **not** guarded beyond that — no confirmation dialog exists anywhere in this game.
- **Every damaged building wears an hp bar** (`drawHealthBar`, centred on the sprite, `sy - 5`),
  drawn only once `hp < maxHp` so an untouched base stays clean — and never while `building`, when
  hp is climbing rather than falling. The bot bay is excluded: `drawBayOverlay` draws its own at
  `sy - 11`. Below 60% hp a building also picks up four crack marks placed as fractions of its
  sprite, so damage reads without the bar.
- None of the four structures emits light (see [Lighting](rendering.md#lighting)).

## Robots

`robots` holds the bay-owned worker bots (one 12×10 faceless tread-bot grid in team colour, two
tread frames — see [sprites.md](sprites.md)) — and the two eagles' [merchants](#the-merchant),
which ride the same list with `merchant: true`. `updateRobot()` mirrors the animal state machine plus
jobs — `updateUnitStatus` first, so a chassis wears every state a player can be put under
(`makeRobot` clears the full set into it): rooted, netted, slowed, marked, stunned, on fire, and
scrapped by a burn like anything else ([status effects](#status-effects-one-set-for-every-unit)).
The root and the slow are spent inside `navStep` for a routed drive and folded into `wander()` by
hand for the loiter, which is the only movement a worker steers itself. **What job it runs is decided by the [worker flag](#worker-flags) of the player who owns its
bay** (`flagOf(b)`); with no flag it falls back to the original bay-centred gather: pick the
nearest tree/rock within 8 tiles of the bay's mouth (`structMouth`, also where they deposit)
(`nearestObj`, the predicate generalisation of `nearestBerryBush`), work it in 0.9 s ticks into a
`carry` gold count (same `YIELD` numbers as `hitObject`, tree-fall leaves a stump and pays the
jackpot — banked in the carry rather than paid on the spot), and walk home to deposit into their
owner's `inv.gold` with a floater at 8+ carried. A worker's `harvest()` handles **deadTree** too (the dire hollow's ring: quicker,
`YIELD.deadTree*`, and felling one calls `flushBirds`), because a flag can be planted on one.
Robots drive on `navStep` ([Pathfinding](#pathfinding): reach 1 to a tree, rock or building,
reach 0 to a body or home) and are solid to players and animals (see
[Unit collisions](#unit-collisions)); a target
with no route, or one they get pinned on the way to, goes on `b.avoid` for 12 s. They die with
their bay and are reaped like animals. They inherit their bay's `team`/`owner`, join the y-sorted draws via
`drawRobot()` in team colours (the whole sprite bobs while driving, the tool swings at a target,
carried gold shows as a nugget up front), and show a health bar. Their SFX are gated on player proximity
(`nearPlayer`) so a remote base doesn't spam audio.

**A worker can now fight.** One axe swing, `ROBOT_DMG` (5) every `ROBOT_ATK_CD` (1.1 s) at
anything inside `ROBOT_REACH` (15 px) — deliberately flat, with nothing scaling it yet; that is
the balance pass. `robotStrike(b, e, pt)` is the single blow: a building goes through
`hurtStruct` (the same path a player's E swing takes, so the wreck, the rubble payout and the
`WRECKED A` line are one code path), and any **body** through `hurtUnit` with `cause: 'worker'` —
all credited to `players[b.owner]`, so a worker kill pays the bounty and levels its owner like any
other. `cause` doubles as the feed's **verb** (`KILL_VERB`), so a
worker kill reads `YOU CUT DOWN <NAME>` instead of `SHOT`. Targets come from
`robotFoeUnit(b, range)` (nearest enemy player or worker; players are noticed through `seenAt`, so a
buried body is as invisible to a worker as to a wolf) and `enemyStructNear(team, x, y, r)`.
`foePoint(e, fx, fy)` is where the axe lands: a body a little above its feet, or **the nearest
point on a building's footprint** — the bay is 3×2 and a worker measuring to its centre could
never reach past the wall it is standing against. The same swing animation `drawRobot()` already
had draws it, off `b.atkAim` and `b.atkCd` instead of `b.tgt` and `b.workT`.

A worker is **shootable**: `robotHit(b, x, y)` is its hitbox (radius 7 about `b.y - 1`, the middle
of a body whose treads sit at `b.y + 4`), and `hurtRobot(b, dmg, nx, ny, src)` is the single entry
point for damage — flash, knockback, a damage floater, a scrap-and-sparks burst, `SFX.hit`, and
`robotDies` at zero. Shots reach it (only from another team — friendly fire is off, as it is for
players, so a bay's own side drives through its workers safely), and so does every class ability
and the roll, all of them through `hurtUnit`. `robotDies(b, src)`
**hands whatever the worker was hauling to whoever downed it** (`awardGold` on `b.carry`) — which
is what keeps shooting a loaded worker on its way home worth the arrows — and logs
`<NAME> SCRAPPED A WORKER` to the feed. A downed worker is not a downed player, so it never touches
the kill count. `updateRobot`'s own `hp <= 0` check routes through the same function (with no
`src`, so the wreck goes unclaimed). Turret bolts ride the arrow pipeline, so a turret's mark
finally dies; a rival's **worker on an attack flag** melees one; a rival's abilities and roll catch
one like any other body; nothing else — a player's E swing, wildlife, the AI's target
picker — goes after a worker.

`hurtRobot` also sets `b.mad`/`b.madT`/`b.madX`/`b.madY` when the hit came from another team **and
the worker is under a flag**: it fights back for `ROBOT_MAD` (6 s) from where it was standing, and
never follows past `ROBOT_LEASH` (90 px) of that spot. An unflagged worker is the same defenceless
hauler it always was — see [Worker flags](#worker-flags) for why the anger is gated on the flag.

### Soldiers: the waves

The `soldiers` banner (js/robots.js). Every `STRUCTS.barracks.waveT` seconds each merchant's
[barracks](#base-building) rolls out a column of **soldiers** — the worker's chassis under its
side's pennant (`drawRobot` stamps `drawFlagPennant` on a `kind: 'soldier'` body, the one thing
that says this bot is not here to chop) — that marches [the road](world.md#the-road) to the rival
bird. `makeSoldier(o)` is `makeRobot` with `kind: 'soldier'`, `owner: -1` (no flag reads it, no
cargo, no payout but the bounty) and a **route**: its own eagle's mouth (out of the roost's lane),
`roadWaypoints(team)`, the rival's mouth; the rival roost itself is read live each frame, since
it may have flown. `updateSoldier` is four rungs, first hit wins:

1. a rival **unit** inside `SOLDIER_AGGRO` (96 px — `robotFoeUnit`, so a buried hunter lets a
   column walk past): close and swing (`robotStrike`, the worker's own `ROBOT_DMG` every
   `ROBOT_ATK_CD`, `cause: 'soldier'` — `DEATH_CAUSE.soldier` is the feed line);
2. the rival **bird** inside six tiles: the nearest roost tile (`aiEagleTile`), and
   `SOLDIER_EAGLE_DMG` (8, against a hand's 20) a swing through `hurtEagle` — ahead of any
   building, since the gate's whole stump ring stands within a step of the roost;
3. a rival **building** inside `SOLDIER_SIEGE` (40 px — what is in its way: a gate turret, a
   wall across the gap, the rival barracks): `hurtStruct` through the same `robotStrike`;
4. the **march**: the next waypoint (`SOLDIER_WP_R` to count it reached; one `navStep` cannot
   route to is *skipped*, never waited on, so a column never stands on a blocked tile), then the
   roost through its lane.

It is allowed to fight and nothing else — no tree tempts it, no flag recalls it. Two waves
meeting on the road therefore grind each other down (they are rival units to each other), which
is the stalemate a player breaks by walking out. It takes every hit, state and sweep like any
other body (`bot: true` is what `isAnimalUnit` reads to send a blow down the robot path rather
than the animal one — a soldier carries a `kind` too), the roosting bird's **gust** rears at it
and buffets it like a player (`updateEagle`/`eagleGust`), a turret marks it, and it dies through
`robotDies` carrying a `SOLDIER_BOUNTY` (4 gold, through `awardGold`, so the kill levels too) for
whoever scraps it — no feed line, five a wave. The cap on a barracks' live soldiers is
`STRUCTS.barracks.tiers[0].cap`. Bots read them as attackers at their bird and as targets in
sight, and a pusher walks with its own column ([multiplayer.md](multiplayer.md#bots)).

### The merchant

Each eagle is **driven** by its team's merchant — the old trader in the wide fur hat with the
team-cloth crown and the white beard, seated on the bird's neck in flight (`MERCH_SEAT`, `drawEagle`; the look is
[sprites.md](sprites.md)'s own 16 × 18 grids, built so it never reads as a player on either side,
with a `MERCH` nameplate and a bar in its side's paint over it, `drawMerchant`; the bird wears `PERCH`) — who climbs
down the moment it roosts (`spawnMerchant`, called
from `eagleCrash`, the `merchant` banner in js/robots.js) and works the roost for its side, in
order — with one job that jumps the queue the moment it is due: `MERCH_BAY_T` (30 s) after the
landing it raises the **barracks** ([base building](#base-building)) in the woods `MERCH_BAY_BACK`
(6) tiles *behind* the roost, against the lane: `merchBaySite` picks the nearest 3×2 placement to
that point whose footprint is dry land holding nothing the axe cannot take, `merchBayBlocker`
hands it every pine, snag, rock and stump on the footprint and a `MERCH_BAY_RING` (1) ring round
it, felled at `MERCH_BAY_SWING` (0.34 s — the lane's pace, so the bay is up before the second
minute) through `merchFell` (the rim's swing, factored out — it leaves the tile empty; the rim
puts a stump back), and then `MERCH_BAY_HAMMER` (2.6 s) of hammering from the tile below the
door sets the site (`createStruct`, nobody pays). Wrecked, `b.bay` no longer resolves and the
clock restarts at `MERCH_BAY_REBUILD` (45 s); the clearing is already made, so the second build
is the hammering alone. Otherwise: a **gate** at the mouth of the lane the crash cut — `createStruct` a turret on the crash's
ring stump flanking the lane each side (the nearest stump outside `MERCH_GATE_GAP` of the lane's
centreline — `e.laneDir`, the road's own direction toward the middle of the corner's tree edge,
[the lane](rendering.md#eagle-drop-mode-drop) — on the field side), then walls on the ring stumps out to `MERCH_GATE_W` (`b.plan`,
built in that order, `MERCH_BUILD_T` of hammering each, a site skipped while a body stands on it
and retried last when no route reaches it); then the **rim**: every pine within `MERCH_CLEAR_R`
(5.6 tiles — one ring past `BOOM_STUMP_R`) of the roost felled to a **stump** at
`MERCH_SWING_T` a swing, **paying no gold** (like the crater and the lane — the same free start
for both sides), picking the nearest pine to itself that still has an open side to stand on and
keeping a timed `b.avoids` list of trunks no route reached (one player flipped forever between two
walled-in trees); then it keeps to the lane mouth, a step or two either way — **and keeps shop there**: that post is
[the counter](#the-merchants-counter), open to either team, and it stands still and faces its
customer for as long as one is being served.

It is a unit in `robots` with `merchant: true` and `kind: 'merchant'`: the same
`separateUnits` (player radius and mass — `unitRadius`/`UNIT_MASS.merchant`) and y-sorted draw a
worker rides, dispatched to `updateMerchant`/`drawMerchant` off the flag after `updateRobot`'s
shared status/stun handling. The gate's owner is the team's first player (kill credit for the
turrets' bolts). `owner` is -1, so it reads no flag and no flag ever recalls it.

**It cannot be hurt, and it has no `hp` field at all rather than a large one.** `unitAlive`
(js/actions.js) answers false for a merchant, and that one function is the gate every target
picker in the game asks — the arrow loop, the roll's sweep, `unitsNear`/`unitsHit`, a turret's
`turretFoe`, a worker's `robotFoeUnit`, a flag's `flagUnitAt` and the cursor's hunt reticle — so
it is invisible to every weapon in the world rather than merely immune to one of them. It draws no
health bar either: a full bar that could never move would promise a fight that is not on offer.
There is no second driver and now there never needs to be. `DBG.merchants` lists both.

## Worker flags

**One order marker per player, planted with the middle mouse button, that every worker bot that
player owns reads as its standing order.** Two players on one team have one flag each; the crew a
flag commands is `b.owner === p.id`, i.e. everyone out of the bays that player built. The whole
system is the `worker flags` banner in [robots.js](../../js/robots.js), plus the dispatch
at the tail of `updateRobot()`.

**What the flag is standing on IS the order.** There is no menu and no mode. `flagResolve(p, tx, ty)`
is the one function that decides, and both the cursor preview and `plantFlag` read it, so what the
pointer promises is what the crew does:

| under the flag | job | what the crew does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a unit on another team | `hunt` | chase *that* unit anywhere and kill it |
| a building on another team | `siege` | break it, then the nearest enemy building within `FLAG_SIEGE_R` (14 tiles) of the flag |
| your own building | `guard` | ring up on its `structMouth` and hold; swing at any foe inside `ROBOT_AGGRO` (70 px) without leaving the post |
| a tree, dead tree or rock | `harvest` | cut that spot, then spread outward over `FLAG_HARVEST_R` (7 tiles) |
| open ground within `FLAG_BASE_R` (9 tiles) of an enemy building | `march` | route there fighting hostile *units* met on the way, then hold |
| open ground anywhere else | `path` | clear a straight lane to it from the bay's mouth, chopping and mining what is in the way |

Only `job` (and a hunt's `unit`) is stored on `p.flag = { tx, ty, job, unit }`. Everything else is
re-read off the tile as it is needed, which is what makes the jobs *survive their own success*:
felling the tree a harvest flag stands on spreads the crew outward instead of stranding it, and
wrecking the building a siege flag stands on rolls them straight on to the next one. A hunt whose
mark dies falls back to holding the flag's ground.

- **`path`** builds its lane with `flagCorridor(from, tx, ty)` — the straight line from
  `structMouth(b.home)` out to the flag, `FLAG_PATH_W` (1) tiles either side of it, walked
  **outward** so a crew clears from the door forward rather than from the far end back.
  `flagPathTarget` hands each worker the first obstacle in it no sibling has already claimed
  (`objTaken`), so they fan out along the lane instead of stacking on one trunk. Once the lane is
  open they fall through to harvesting around the far end.
- **Only the three attack jobs chase** (`FLAG_ATTACK`). On every other flag a worker swings back
  at whoever hit it and no further ([Robots](#robots), `b.mad`). **Moving the flag home is the
  retreat** — there is no separate order for it.
- **The middle button is press-and-HOLD, not a click.** The press raises the preview
  (`state.flagAim`), the release plants where the pointer ended up — the build wheel's grammar one
  button over. It is a *gesture and not a mode* on purpose: everything else in this game that
  previews, previews something you are already doing (the aim line needs a drawn bow, the wheel a
  held right-click), and an always-on hover ghost for an order you have not started is clutter
  that also fights `drawSelection` for the same tile. **Nothing about the flag is on screen unless
  `state.flagAim` is true.** Escape or losing window focus drops it — the press has no hub to
  release into, so those two are the cancel. The press is refused outright when `hasWorkers(p)` is
  false (a live worker, or a bay about to roll one out): with nobody to order, the button is dead.
- The gesture **plants, moves and picks up**: releasing on the flag's own tile lifts it, and a
  lifted flag hands the crew back to the bay, which is exactly the behaviour that existed before
  flags did. Releasing over the HUD is "thought better of it". `flagRecall(p)` clears every
  commanded worker's target and route the frame an order lands, so the crew is *visibly* seen to
  turn.
- It works **over the chart (M) too**, through `mapTileAt(sx, sy)` — the only way to command a tile
  that is off-screen. At `MAP_S` (192/232 px per tile) one chart pixel is ~1.2 tiles, so a map
  order is ±1 tile: fine for "march on that base", not for picking one tree.
- The flag has **no resting affordance by design**, and no hint text either (the onboarding
  teaching lines were removed with the rest of the text hints): the ESC panel's CONTROLS block is
  where the middle-mouse binding is looked up.
- The order is per-player state, not a world resource, so it does **not** go through `contest()`.
  bots never plant one, which is why a bot's bay still gathers exactly as it always did.

**What it looks like** (the `what a flag looks like` group in [draw-world.js](../../js/draw-world.js)
draws all three; `FLAG_JOBS`, in robots.js, holds the 7×7 icon grids as camp-glyph-style rect lists):

- **The preview**, up only while the press is held, in two halves because they live in two spaces.
  Both read `flagTarget()`, which resolves the tile once and returns `null` for every reason
  nothing should be drawn (no `flagAim`, an overlay up, the pointer over the HUD).
  `drawFlagAim(ox, oy)` marks the target tile in the **world** pass, right beside `drawSelection` —
  the same four 3 px corner brackets over the same offset dark rim, so it scales with the tile and
  speaks the language the E bracket already speaks. It does **not** pulse: the E bracket breathes
  to catch an eye that isn't looking, and this one is only on screen because a hand is holding it
  there. `drawFlagCursor()` rides the pointer in the **UI** pass at a fixed size, carrying the
  job's icon — or the flag itself, when the release would lift it.
- **Two colours, and they carry the stakes, not the job** (`FLAG_MINE` / `FLAG_FOE`): anything
  pointed at your own side is the game's standard bright ink, the three that point at another team
  are the danger red. The *icon* says which job it is; amber and green are already spoken for
  (affordable / interactable, and good) and a work order is neither. `FLAG_MINE` is `#f4f7ff` and
  not a softer slate for a reason — this world is snow, and anything near it disappears into the
  ground; it reads for the same reason `drawSelection`'s white brackets do.
- **The planted flag**, `drawFlag()`, y-sorted into the world draws half a pixel behind its own
  tile so a flag on a tree isn't swallowed by the canopy: a pole with a **dark banner carrying the
  same job icon inked in the team's colour**. Dark cloth and a bright glyph, not the reverse — at
  nine pixels square a solid colour with a hole punched in it is a blob, and the glyph is the
  message. Only your own side's flags are drawn (an order marker is not intelligence to hand a
  rival), on all three surfaces.
- **Both maps**, through the shared `drawFlagPennant()`: a pole-and-pennant in the team's colour on
  the minimap disc, and the same pennant with the job icon over it on the chart. The chart's
  *hover* preview is gated on `state.flagAim` exactly like the world's — the planted pennants are
  always drawn, the preview never is.

## Death and respawn

Death is a walk back, never the end: while your team's eagle still roosts (`teamEagleDown`, the
eagle-drop banner in js/boot.js) going down costs a timer and everything you carried, and you are
set down again at the bird ([Respawn at the bird](multiplayer.md#respawn-at-the-bird)); once the
eagle has been driven off every death on that side is permanent, and that is the only way anyone
is ever out of a match. `die(p, src, cause)` marks that player dead and drops its bow draw and
momentum either way. **Death empties the wallet** (`spillInventory(p, killer)`, right beside
`die`): a credited killer pockets the victim's gold outright through `awardGold` — so a kill levels
the killer, which is the bounty that makes taking the fight worth it — while an uncredited death
(ice, wolves, or the killer already dead) takes its gold down with the body, because gold is never
a physical drop. Any other `inv` key would spill as pickups split into up to 3 drops. **The
backpack empties too**, one drop per stack — a stack is already the unit the bag counts in, so a
killer whose own bag is full simply leaves them lying; this is also, for free, how an **unopened
roguelike card drops on death** (see [Roguelike cards](#roguelike-cards)) — a picked card is
already baked into the kit, not an item, so only what's still sitting unopened in the bag spills.
**And the four weapon slots empty with it**, each tool going down *loaded*: a build lies where its
owner fell, for whoever walks over it, and `reset()` hands the dead player its class's starting
loadout back — so a respawn is armed but is not the player it was. (An item riding the cursor
mid-drag goes back in the bag first, so it spills with the rest instead of vanishing with the hand
holding it.) All three loops are generic per type, so a future resource spills without touching
death code, and an instanced tool travels as the same object it always was
(`spawnDrop`'s `it`). The standings are unaffected because `scoreOf` ranks lifetime
`xp`, not the purse, so a looted player keeps the place it earned. `die` also credits the kill (and
heals the killer if their kit carries `killHeal`, off a card) and writes the feed line — see
[Kills and the event feed](multiplayer.md#kills-and-the-event-feed) — then asks
`teamEagleDown(p.team)`: with the eagle still roosting, `p.respawnT` starts counting down
(`respawnTime(p)`, `updateRespawns` — see [Respawn at the bird](multiplayer.md#respawn-at-the-bird)
for the whole path); with it driven off, `p.eliminated = true`, the permanent path. Either way
`checkLastStanding()` asks whether every **rival team** is now gone, which ends the match as a
win — a team-level question a kill can never answer, since a side is in the match while its bird
roosts ([PvP](multiplayer.md#pvp)).

Either way the local player's overlay goes up through `endMatch('lost' | 'won' | 'respawning')` (the
`death & spectate` banner): `state.mode = 'dead'`, every local overlay closed, and the screen goes
to a dim with two planks — **SPECTATE** and **LOBBY** — for `'lost'` (permanent), to
[the victory screen](rendering.md#the-end-screens), whose planks are **KEEP PLAYING** and
**LOBBY**, for `'won'`, or, for `'respawning'` (temporary), to **the wait**: no dim and no planks
at all — `endMatch` puts the view on an ally (`state.deadView = 'spec'`, `specNext` keeping to
the side's own through `specOk`), one line — **RESPAWNING IN Ns** at 3× in the upper band — reads
the live countdown, and [the replay window](rendering.md#replay-the-last-four-seconds) opens large
over the view with a close box on its corner (or ESC), so the death is watched first and the ally
after, the player choosing when. **LOBBY** on a `'lost'` dim does not leave: it opens
[the defeat screen](rendering.md#the-end-screens), the loss's own summary, and that screen's single
plank is the door out — a lost match ends when you stop watching it, not the instant you go down.
`'respawning'` needs no state of its own beyond `state.rpClosed` (reset by every `endMatch`):
once `p.respawnT` hits 0, `respawnPlayer(p)` snaps `state.mode` back to `'play'` the same
one-line way `'KEEP PLAYING'` already does, lands the local player at its bird, and replays the HUD
slide-in a fresh eagle landing gets. A win *or* an elimination also freezes what its screen will
print (`endSnapshot()` on `state.end`: gold, kills, level, clock, team, class, the kit, and the
placing and killer only the loss prints) because the match keeps running underneath and a total
that climbs behind a tally which already counted it reads as a bug — and because a loss's summary
is opened off a plank minutes later, by which time none of those numbers are still true. Spectating
sets `state.spec` to a living player's id and `viewPlayer()` — the one place the camera and minimap
ask who to frame — returns it. The control is
a top-centre `[<] NAME [>]` strip (`specLayout`/`specHit`, sized to the widest player name so the
arrows never shift): clicking an arrow or pressing the arrow keys cycles (`specNext`, player order,
skipping the dead — and skipping rivals while a respawn wait runs, since the wait is not a scouting
window), ESC returns to the planks (on a wait, which has none, it closes the replay instead), and a
watched player that dies hands the view to the next. There is deliberately no hint text — the arrows are the whole explanation (CLAUDE.md's
"show, don't label" rule); with nobody left the plate shows a dash instead of a name. LOBBY (`toLobby`) fades to dark and reloads
the page on the same seed, which boots into the title screen. **TAB still opens the standings
while you are out**, which is the point of holding them above the dim.
`state.mode` is `title | drop | play | dead`, and `updatePlay()` runs in `play`, `dead` **and**
`drop` (the clock starts with the eagle; airborne players are skipped) — the match carries on
without you, and `updateRespawns` ticks a respawn timer down under the `'respawning'` overlay the
same way. Only **pause (P) and the settings panel (ESC)** stop the sim;
`update()` (time, darkness, camera, fx) always keeps running. In `title` only the ambient half
runs (`updateTitle`: animals and fish) — see [Main menu](rendering.md#main-menu-title).

## The M map does not pause

**M** opens the world chart with the sim still stepping, the same deal the
[build wheel](#base-building) takes: night still falls, arrows still fly, bots still hunt you.
`sampleHumanInput` handles it in its own branch, and the rule is *the map keeps your feet and
nothing else*: `mx`/`my`, `slide` and the grapple's held key are read as usual, the edge-triggered
`dodge` passes
straight through, and `fire`/`work`/`eatBerry`/`eatFish`/`cmd` are dropped along with any held
draw (the pointer is over the parchment, so there is nothing to aim or work at, and a gear plate
bought blind under the dim would be bought by accident). So you walk with the chart up and watch
your own marker cross it. Consequences worth knowing:

- The replay ring keeps recording (`replayLive`) — the capture point is above the map's dim, so
  the banked frames are clean world frames. `replayShowing` still hides the *window* under the panel.
- Dying with the map open is now possible; `endMatch` clears `state.mapOpen` (and
  `state.bagOpen`), and M only toggles in `play` and `drop` modes (mid-flight it is the ride's
  wide read; `landPlayer` closes it at touchdown), so the chart cannot survive into the death
  overlay.
- The world keeps the zoom you were playing at. The panel is a fixed 308×226 and the canvas no
  longer shrinks when you zoom ([World zoom](rendering.md#world-zoom-and-the-two-pixel-spaces)),
  so it fits regardless and the map no longer yanks the camera back to base.

## Settings

`settings` (`v`, `volume`, `musicVol`, `sfxVol`, `mmR`, `mmZoom`, `hudScale`, `shake`, `muted`, `info`, `pixelCursor`, `hitbox`,
`teamBlue` — your side always painted BLUE, see [teams and colours](multiplayer.md#teams-and-colours) —
`aiLevel` — the rival bots' difficulty notch on class select, an index into `AI_LEVELS` (js/ai.js) —
`mobile` — the TOUCH MODE row, `'auto'` / `'on'` / `'off'` over the device's own answer
([phones](rendering.md#phones)) — `hudScaleM` — the HUD SIZE a phone plays at, the one
slider editing whichever of the two is live — `binds` — the key each action is bound to
([the three controllers](multiplayer.md#the-three-controllers)) —
and the five video toggles `vidClouds`/`vidRays`/`vidStars`/`vidSnow`/`vidVig`) persists
**under the player profile** — `saveSettings()` is a call to `PROFILE.putSettings()` and
`loadSettings()` reads `PROFILE.settings()`, which returns `null` when this profile has never
saved any. A pre-profile save under the old `localStorage['softfall.settings']` key is folded in
once by `PROFILE.load()` and the key removed; see
[architecture.md](architecture.md#profilejs). `applyMinimapSize()` must be called after changing `mmR` —
it recomputes `MM_R`/`MM_CX`/`MM_CY`. `hudScale` (the HUD SIZE slider, 0.75–1.5, default **0.8**) needs no apply
call: the hud strip reads it live every frame
([rendering.md](rendering.md#the-hud-strip)). The **backpack**'s open/closed state is `state.bagOpen`,
not a setting: it is per-match HUD, and `endMatch` closes it. (Old saves may still carry `res`, `fps`, `seed` or `paths` keys from removed settings;
`Object.assign` in `loadSettings` copies them harmlessly and nothing reads them.)

There is no fullscreen control in the ESC menu (players use F11; a phone asks for it on the
first finger, `mobileGesture`); a `fullscreenchange` listener still refits the canvas when the
browser toggles it.

**The panel is tabbed.** A navbar under the title splits the rows into four pages — GAME
(minimap size, hud size, screen shake, info display, cursor, my team, touch mode), VIDEO (below),
AUDIO (the three sound dials and the speaker), CONTROLS (three baked listings, below) — and each page scrolls independently
inside the content window (`SET_CONTENT_Y`..`SET_CONTENT_B`, panel-local 36..202) when its rows
outgrow it, which is what lets the slab hold any number of future settings: 218 is already close
to the 240-row floor `fitCanvas()` guarantees, so it can never get taller. The wheel over the
open panel scrolls the open page (both the in-match ESC slab and the title's slide-in — the
title also takes W/S and the arrows), a 1 px thumb on the right edge appears only when a page
overflows, and the open page's name wears gold with a gold underline while the others sit dim
until hovered. Everything inside the panel is laid out by **`settingsLayout()`** (panels.js) off
the row tables in `SET_TABS` — draw, hit test and the `DBG.settingsRows` anchors all read the
same function, so a click can never disagree with a pixel. Rows keep the **14 px pitch**;
`settingsHit()`'s bands are `y-3 .. y+10`, touching but never overlapping, so one click can
never land on two rows. It answers a row id, `'mute'`, `'leave'`, `'tab:<id>'`, `'ctab:<id>'`
(a CONTROLS sub-tab) or `'c:<row>:<opt>'` (a choice row's word). A **choice row** carries its
own `val()` and `pick(id)` in `SET_TABS` — QUALITY's are the preset macro, TOUCH MODE's set
`settings.mobile` and re-fit the view — so the draw (the word in force wears gold), the hit and
the click all read one table.

**The VIDEO page** holds one QUALITY row and five toggles, every one a cosmetic-only render
pass a weak GPU can shed (they read at draw time; nothing the sim computes changes):
CLOUD SHADOWS (`vidClouds` — `cloudShade`'s two full-view multiply fills, the one pass that
costs every daytime frame), SUN SHAFTS (`vidRays` — `godRays` and its motes), ICE STARS
(`vidStars` — the whole `drawIceStars` pass, mirror included), SNOWFALL (`vidSnow` — the
falling flakes' draw; the sim still moves them), VIGNETTE (`vidVig` — the frame vignette only,
the hurt flash is feedback and never goes). The QUALITY row's LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH words are a
macro over the first four plus VIGNETTE (`VID_PRESETS`): LOW turns them all off, MEDIUM keeps
everything but the cloud shadows, HIGH is everything, and the word matching the current mix
wears gold — a hand-picked mix golds none of them. SNOWFALL is deliberately in no preset:
falling snow is the game's identity and nearly free, so only a deliberate hand turns it off.

**The in-match slab hangs one plank under itself: the way out.** A frost plank
(`leavePlankRect`, drawn by the title's own `drawMenuButton`) reads LEAVE MATCH in a match and
LEAVE PRACTICE in [practice](world.md#the-practice-arena) — the ESC slab is the one menu either
has, so its exit lives there. `settingsHit()` answers `'leave'` for it (only while
`state.settingsOpen`, so the title's slide-in never grows it) and the click is `toLobby()`
(js/screens.js, the death screen's own fade back to the title on this seed) or
`leavePractice()` (js/menu.js, the reroll's whiteout onto a bare URL, landing on a fresh title
world).

**Mute is not a row.** It is a 9×9 speaker plate (`muteBtnRect`, `drawMuteBtn`) hard against the
left end of the MASTER track on the AUDIO page — `muteBtnRect()` returns `null` on any other
page, and its callers null-check: a cone with two waves coming off it, the waves swapped for a
red × when it is off. While muted all three sound dials draw grey rather than gold
(`drawSliderRow`'s `dim`), so what the speaker silences reads off the page without a word of
text. **N** still toggles the same flag from anywhere.

**The CONTROLS page is itself tabbed** — KEYBOARD, GAMEPAD, TOUCH (`CTRL_TABS`), one listing per
controller, since a phone and a pad each put the same verbs somewhere else. Its sub-navbar is
pinned at the top of the content window (`CTRL_TAB_H`) and only the listing under it scrolls;
it opens on the controller in hand (`ctrlTabNow`: TOUCH on a phone, GAMEPAD while a pad is
active — a green pip beside that word says one is — KEYBOARD otherwise) until a click picks
one. The pad's and the touch listing are baked once (`bakeCtrlPad`/`bakeCtrlTouch` into
`ctrlCvs`, panels.js); **KEYBOARD is live**: two columns of verbs, each rebindable one beside
its key drawn as a **cap** — the same cap the work prompt wears in the world (`drawKeyCap`,
ui.js), printing whatever key the action is bound to — and the fixed ones (the mouse's
buttons, ESC, SCROLL, F3, `.`) as plain gold text, since nothing about them can be pressed. A
cap is a button: it lifts white on hover, a click sets it **listening** (the face pulses gold)
and the next key down is its key; a key another cap holds swaps the two, a reserved key is
refused, Escape or a click elsewhere calls it off
([rebinding](multiplayer.md#the-three-controllers)). RESET at the foot of the right column puts
the defaults back and sits dim while they already are. `KEY_ROWS` is the two columns (an
action id, a run of caps on one verb — MOVE, ABILITIES — or a fixed pair), `keyRowsLayout`
places every cap and word listing-local, and the draw (`drawKeyRows`), `settingsHit`
(`'key:<action>'`, `'keyreset'`) and `DBG.keyRows` all read it. Under a rule at
`KEYS_PRIMER_Y`, baked (`bakeCtrlKeys`), **THE WEAPON** — the one thing about the left button a
new player cannot work out by pressing it, drawn rather than explained (`drawToolPrimer`); the
page is long enough that its scroll track appears.
GAMEPAD draws each button as a picture (`drawPadGlyph`: a face button is a disc with its
letter, a bumper a flat pill, a trigger a tall one, a stick a ring, the dpad a cross with its
pressed arm lit) beside its verb, the play set on the left and the held gestures and the menu
set on the right. TOUCH draws each plate with the plate's own glyph (`drawTouchIcon`, ui.js) and
the two sticks. The bindings themselves: [the three controllers](multiplayer.md#the-three-controllers).

The primer is a **real HORN BOW carrying a real overload** — ARROW 2, FLAME 4, ARROW 2, THROWING
LOG 8 against a tensile of 15 — run through `toolPlan` at bake time, so every number on it is the
game's own arithmetic and the picture cannot drift from the weapon. The cells, the hatch on the
modifier, the weight pips, the rail, the gold lead bar, the budget track and the "!" are the **same marks** the shelf and
the weapon well draw in play (`modPlate` / `drawOverWarn`, ui.js, both of which take the context
to paint so a bake can borrow them) — that is the whole point: what is learned here is recognised
there. A gold arrow up the left edge is the firing order, each cell is annotated in its own bit's
colour with the log's cell red and washed out, and two lines close it: one press fires every bit
the tool can afford, and two of one modifier compound. The title screen's TUTORIAL panel carries
the same keys under `1-4 CLASS ABILITIES`.

`settings.info` (one INFO DISPLAY toggle row in the ESC menu, **or F3**, minecraft-style — the
keydown handler flips it in any mode and suppresses the browser's find bar; default off) shows
the **info stack** — `drawTags()`, a vertical list on the left edge at the top quarter of the
view, drawn above every overlay. Four lines — **FPS** (`loop()`
accumulates raw unclamped frame deltas into `perf` and refreshes `perf.fps` every half second),
**SFX**, the sampled sound bank's decoded/asked-for tally (below),
**POS**, the tile coordinates of the player the camera frames (`viewPlayer()`, so spectators read
the watched player), and **SEED**, the run seed (see
[world.md](world.md#determinism-and-noise)) — each drawn as a dim label plus a value on one
shared x, so the numbers line up in a column; that dim-label / bright-value pairing is the same
one the berry and fish counters use. **Red on the fps value (below 45) is the only colour in the
stack that means anything** alongside **SFX** (below), and nothing else is tinted, which is what
lets a warning read. In title, FPS and SFX show and the other two do not.

**SFX** is the sampled sound bank: files decoded / files the table asks for, from `SFX.banked()`,
red on anything missing. It earns its place in a three-line stack because an empty bank is *silent
in exactly the way a mis-wired cue is* — every sampled sound falls back to its synth line and the
game sounds untouched — so without it "I hear no new sounds" has three indistinguishable causes.
See [Audio](#audio).

`settings.hitbox` is the same idea one key over: **`.`** toggles it 0 ↔ 2 in any mode. One press
draws the circles and boxes the sim actually tests over the sprites that hide them, *and* the
route every walker is following with the tile it is heading for; the next press turns both off. It
has no ESC-menu row, only the `. HITBOX` line in the CONTROLS block; the rest is in
[Debug overlays](rendering.md#debug-overlays-hitboxes-and-routes).

Beneath the minimap
`renderMinimap()` prints one centred row: a 5×7 pixel figure (`ALIVE_ICON`, no label) with
`aliveCount()` — players active and not dead, riders included — then the elapsed clock.

## Audio

[js/audio.js](../../js/audio.js) is three layers under one master dial, and `SFX` is all of them.

`ensure()` builds the graph lazily: `master` (the master dial) → destination, and `sfxBus` (the
SOUNDS dial) under it. **Everything synthesised or sampled goes through `sfxBus`**, the wind bed
included — a new voice that connects to `master` directly would ignore the SOUNDS dial. The three
dial setters go through `dial(v, keep)`, which keeps the old value for anything that is not a
finite **number** — note the `typeof` test, since `+null` is `0`, not `NaN`, and a coercing guard
would let a null from a stale save clamp a whole bus to silence. Music runs *outside* this graph,
so a zeroed or broken `sfxBus` is silent while the songs play on, which is a confusing failure to
be handed and worth guarding against. Browsers
require a user gesture, so `SFX.unlock()` is called from click handlers; audio.js also arms its
own `pointerdown`/`mousedown`/`keydown` listeners, which is what actually starts the title track
(see *Music* below).

**The synth** (`tone`/`noise`) is unchanged, and it is now two things: the UI blips in their own
right, and the fallback line under every sampled cue.

**Samples.** `SAMPLES` maps a key to the files behind it in `audio/sfx/`; `loadBank()` decodes all
of them on the first `ensure()`.

**The bytes come from [js/sfxdata.js](../../js/sfxdata.js), not from the network.** That file is
generated — `node app/bake-sfx.js` writes every clip in `audio/sfx/` into it as base64 — and it exists
because **double-clicking `index.html` has to work**: a `file://` page is allowed neither `fetch`
nor XHR against its own folder, so the whole sample layer fell back to synth when the game was
opened off the disk rather than served, sounding *exactly* as it did before the samples existed.
`bytes(f)` prefers the inline data and falls back to `fetch` for a clip that is in the folder but
not yet baked, so adding one works over http before anyone reruns the script — **rerun it before
committing, or the new sound is dead for anyone opening the file directly.** The music is
deliberately *not* baked: it is ~70 MB, and an `<audio>` element streams a relative `file://` path
perfectly well — it was only ever `fetch` that was blocked. Filenames still go through
`encodeURIComponent` on the fetch path, since several carry a `#` that a raw URL reads as a
fragment. Each decoded buffer is run through `trim()`,
which finds where the sound actually starts and ends inside a clip padded out to a fixed length,
so an axe hit does not fire 200 ms late.

**`trim()` also levels the bank, and that is not cosmetic.** These files arrive at wildly
different levels — measured peaks run from **0.089** (the chewing) to **1.03** (the falling tree),
a 20 dB spread — so each one gets a gain `g` bringing it to `SMP_PEAK`, capped at `SMP_MAXG` so a
near-silent clip is not amplified into hiss. Without it the quiet third of the bank is inaudible
under the music at any sane master setting, *and* no per-cue `vol` can be tuned, because the same
number means something different for every file. With it, `vol` is a pure mix control: every world
cue is aimed at **0.3–0.7 peak on the SOUNDS bus**, measured with `SFX.meter()`, against the synth
UI blips at 0.15–0.18. Peak is taken across **all** channels (the files are stereo) and the
silence threshold is relative to that peak — an absolute one trims the quiet clips' own content
off as if it were padding.

**A failed load must never be quiet about it.** `loadBank()` counts every file into `bankStat`
(`want`/`got`/`err`), logs one console warning naming the first failure, and `SFX.banked()` reads
the tally back — the **info stack prints `SFX got/want`, red when anything is missing**. This is
not decoration: an empty bank falls back to the synth on every cue, so the game sounds *exactly as
it did before the samples existed*, which is indistinguishable by ear from every cue being wired
to the wrong event. Swallowing those rejections cost two rounds of debugging. A bank that came up
empty also gets one retry on the next gesture (`retryBank`), since starting the dev server after
opening the page is the ordinary way this happens.

`smp(key, opts)` plays one, **and returns whether it handled the cue**: false means nothing has
decoded yet (or ever will — `file://`, a missing folder, a codec) and the caller falls through to
its synth line, so the game is never silent waiting on a download. It returns *true* while muted,
so a muted cue never doubles up. Every cue therefore reads
`someCue() { if (smp('key', {...})) return; ...synth... }`. `opts`: `vol`, `rate` + `jitter` (a
fraction of rate, rolled per shot, which is what stops a repeated cue sounding looped), `lp`/`hp`
filter corners, `delay`, `gap` (the minimum seconds between two of this key — insurance against
two events in one frame), and `dur`. **`dur` matters more than it looks:** several of these clips
hold more than one cue — the footstep file is a whole walking loop, the coin rolls for two seconds
— so `dur` takes one hit off the front and rides a release ramp down over its last 40 ms rather
than clicking off mid-waveform. A key with several files picks one at random per shot.

New sampled cues beside the old synth ones: `coin()` (gold into the purse — an `awardGold`
payout, a bot's deposit) and `stash()` (something into the backpack)
split off from `pickup()`, which stays the synth UI blip so menus keep an instant, identical
click; `hammer()` (raising, upgrading or finishing a structure) splits off from `place()` the same
way, with `building()` as its quieter, shorter sibling on a site's dust tick — it repeats for as
long as the build takes, so it is widely jittered and must never settle into a rhythm. `step()` is
one boot per footprint the local player leaves; `land()` is the same boot dropped an octave under a
low thump, so touching down off the eagle reads as weight rather than as an arrow connecting.
`yelp()` is a creature crying out under a hit it survived, and `monsterDie(kind)` takes the
animal's kind — a wolf yelps where a rabbit squeals.

**The market's four are notification cues, not world sounds**, and they are the one place a cue is
deliberately *not* jittered: `market(up)` plays `spike` (a coin ding) or `crash` (a sad falling
sigh) whole — the ding is spent in under half a second where the sigh sustains and sags for the
best part of one, so the two are told apart by their *shape* and not only by their pitch —
and `restock()` plays two clips as one cue — `freight`, a wagon pulling in, and `restock`, the
bell over the new stock, scheduled `RESTOCK_RING` (0.9 s) behind it through `smp`'s own `delay`.
The wagon runs its full 3.3 s, so it is still rolling under the bell, which is the point: the
goods arrive, *then* they are laid out. Jitter on either half would blur the two beats into one
noise, and a spike that could be mistaken for a crash is worse than no cue at all — these say a
*direction*, like the plates they arrive with ([the market](#the-fish-and-berry-market)).

**Ambience.** `SFX.setAmbience(on, night)` is called every frame from `update()`: on wherever the
world is live, off under the death and end screens where a song already owns the mix. audio.js
schedules a wind gust (or, once `state.darkness > 0.55`, sometimes an owl) every 11–26 s over the
synth wind bed.

**Music.** `SFX.music` streams `audio/music/` through one `HTMLAudioElement` per track — they run
minutes, and decoding them into buffers would cost tens of MB. They sit *outside* the WebAudio
graph, so `musicGain()` multiplies each element's `.volume` by its track volume, the MUSIC dial,
the master dial and mute by hand; a 50 ms `setInterval` walks the fades. `music.play(key, opts)`
crossfades (`in`/`out` seconds, `restart`), is a no-op when that key is already current, and
`music.stop(fade)` fades the whole layer out. `music.current` reads back the key; `music.el(key)`
hands out the live element, which is how a driver proves the handover chain without sitting
through five minutes of a track.

`music.hold(key, opts)` **borrows** the layer for as long as something is up on screen, and
`music.release(opts)` gives it back. A hold notes what was playing **and the second it had
reached** (`music.held`), fades it out, and the release brings it back and seeks it to that
second — so an interruption costs the listener the bars it covered rather than the whole song.
Holding twice over is still one hold: the first thing interrupted is the thing that comes back. An
ordinary `play` or `stop` clears the note, so a track that takes the layer for its own reason (a
victory, the lobby) can never be undone by a release arriving after it. The
[trading post](#the-merchants-counter) is the one caller.

| Track | Plays from | Loops |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `intro` — FROZEN NORTH RUN INTRO | boot, and `leaveSelect()` back to the menu | yes |
| `select` — FROZEN NORTH RUN CLASS SELECTION | `beginSelect()`; the gear pop-up keeps it | yes |
| `eagle` — FLYING ON EAGLE | `beginDrop()` | yes |
| `jump` — JUMPING OFF EAGLE | `dropJump()` for the local player | no → `foxglove` |
| `foxglove` — FOXGLOVE DROP | the end of `jump`, via `TRACKS.next` | no → silence |
| `village` — FOREST VILLAGE LOOP | `openShop()`, as a **hold**; `closeShop()` releases it | yes |
| `wiki` — WHISPERING WOODS | `beginWiki()`, as an ordinary **play**; `leaveWiki()` puts `intro` back | yes |
| `victory` — DROP THE ICE | `endMatch('won')` | yes |
| `defeat` — SLEEPY GAME SAVE | `endMatch('lost')` | yes |

The jump is a **hard cut**, not a crossfade (`{ out: 0.1, in: 0.05 }`): the ride's song is
interrupted by the leap. From there the layer runs itself — `jump` reaches its end, its `ended`
handler follows `TRACKS.next` into `foxglove`, and when *that* ends nothing follows it, so the
match plays out in silence until an end screen. `endMatch` is gated on `'won'`/`'lost'`, each with
its own song (`victory` / `defeat`); a `'respawning'` overlay is not the end of anything and must
not start either.
`rerollWorld()` and `toLobby()` fade the layer out under their wipe; both reload the page, so the
title track comes back from boot.

The **title track cannot start on its own** — no gesture has happened at boot. `musicPlay` catches
the rejected `play()` promise into `pending`, and the first click or keypress starts it. This is
why the dev server ([app/server.js](../../app/server.js)) answers Range requests: served a plain 200, an
`<audio>` element treats a multi-MB mp3 as an unbounded stream (`duration` `Infinity`) and cannot
seek in it.

The bow's rhythm has two of its own: `SFX.nock()` (a dry wooden tick when the renock clears —
deliberately near-silent, since it fires after every shot) and `SFX.dryFire()` (a slack string on
a press the tool cannot answer). See [the cycle](#the-cycle).

[Prone](#prone-under-the-snow) has four: `SFX.bury()` (a body dropping into deep snow — low crunch,
no pitch), `SFX.hidden()` (the cover finishing, barely there on purpose: it is the sound of *not*
being heard, and it plays with a rival somewhere close by), `SFX.rise()` (the snow shed in one
shove) and `SFX.ambush()` (the shot out of the snow landing — deeper and harder than `hit()`, with
a crack over the top, so an ambush never sounds like an ordinary arrow).

`SFX.victory()` (a four-note fanfare over a held low fifth) is the one *synth* cue longer than a
second; `endMatch` fires it the moment the match is won, as the sting the `victory` song comes up
underneath. `SFX.tally()` is the dry blip a climbing number makes on the victory screen — see
[The end screens](rendering.md#the-end-screens) for the rest of that timeline.
