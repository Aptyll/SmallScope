// THE MERCHANT'S COUNTER: the one place gold turns into goods and goods turn
// back into gold. Each eagle's driver (the `merchant` banner, js/robots.js)
// climbs down at the crash, raises the gate, fells the rim and then keeps to
// the lane mouth - and standing beside it there opens this.
//
// BOTH counters serve EVERYBODY. Your own roost's merchant is the near one and
// the rival's is a walk through their base, but neither asks whose side you
// are on, which is exactly why a merchant cannot be killed (unitAlive,
// js/actions.js): a shop nobody can reach is not a shop.
//
// Three things live in this file, in this order:
//   - the MARKET. Fish and berries have a price that MOVES - a random walk
//     with a pull home and the odd shock - and they are the only two things in
//     the game that do. Everything else is priced once, on its own def
//     (`price` on TOOLS/BITS in js/tools.js, CARD_PRICE in js/player.js).
//   - the STOCK. Twelve offers rolled off the tool, bit and card pools, which
//     turn over every SHOP_RESTOCK seconds - the same twelve at both counters,
//     because there is one market and two shopfronts onto it.
//   - the PANEL. Bought from with a click, sold to by DRAGGING out of the
//     pack, which is always up beside it (drawBag, ui.js).
//
// The counter does not stop the sim, and standing at one does not protect you:
// it is HUD like the backpack and the character sheet, and walking out of
// reach shuts it.
// ------------------------------------------------------------ market
// The market's own rng, seeded off SEED the way the chests' is (chRng,

// the shared stream.

// step, and `shock` the chance a step is a LURCH instead - straight to `lo` or
// `hi` of where it stood, which is what makes a market worth watching rather
// than a number that drifts. Fish are the money good and berries the small
// change: a fish is worth four or five berries at rest and the gap widens on
// a spike, so a full bag of fish is a real decision about when to sell it.
// `newsMin` is the OTHER half of the headline test: the gold a move must also

// the world you are about to sell your bag into, and it has to arrive where
// the other things you glance at mid-fight are. So it also raises a PLATE,
// top-right, hard under the minimap beside the clock.

// roost), then what it is about (the good's own item icon beside the
// price it landed on, both at the SAME scale - an 8 px icon against a 10 px
// number reads as a footnote to it, and these two are one reading - or NEW
// STOCK for a turnover, or the NERVE the bird has left), then one glyph
// carrying WHICH WAY - an arrow up or
// an arrow down. A stock plate has no tail: its crate has already said which
// kind of news this is, so the headline takes that room instead. The plate's
// frame and ink carry the same green/red/gold the feed line does, so the two
// readouts of one event never disagree.

// ------------------------------------------------------------ the shop panel
// THE TRADING POST: one slab, the sim running live behind it, and the rest of
// the frame washed dark under it (shopScrim, below). It is pinned into the
// room to the RIGHT of the top-left CORNER rather than dead centre, because
// the weapon shelf and the pack drawer stand there and the drawer is open the
// whole time this is up - a sale is a DRAG out of that grid and into the sell
// strip, so the grid has to be reachable and visible at once (shopLayout).
//
// The name is load-bearing, and the sign says SHOP for the same reason the
// file is called shop.js: the whole slab is the shop, and the MARKET is ONE
// CORNER of it, under its own rule, the only corner whose prices move. Calling
// the whole slab a market would say the twelve offers above it were traded
// goods too, and they are not: every one of them is priced once, on its own
// def. (The building the merchant keeps is still the trading post; that is
// where you are, and this is what it sells.)
//
// Top to bottom: the AWNING - a snow-capped, icicled valance in the counter's
// own team colours, with the shop's sign hung off its hem between two lanterns,
// the merchant's portrait at one end and the purse at the other; the four
// SECTIONS of the stock, three wells each on a recessed board,
// every well wearing its item's own tier plate with its price on a band along
// the bottom; the MARKET rule and its two cards, each carrying a live price, a
// three-day graph and a pair of trade plates whose ARRANGEMENT is the
// direction; the SELL strip - the drop well and the SELL ALL button on one
// line; and the RESTOCK ROAD along the bottom rail.
//
// Two rules make the stock read as one grid rather than as twelve loose
// pictures, which is what it looked like before:
//   - EVERY offer's icon is drawn at the largest WHOLE-NUMBER scale that fits
//     SHOP_ICON (shopIconCv), because a fractional one stretches every third
//     source pixel to double width and a bow's 1px linework comes out frayed.
//     The game keeps its icons on two grids, 8x8 and 12x12; against SHOP_ICON
//     16 that is 2x and 1x, so the counter runs 16s with the three tools at 12
//     rather than a tool with twice the AREA of the bit beside it, which is
//     what it looked like before any of this. A common size for both needs 24,
//     and 24 is bigger than this counter wants its goods to be.
//   - A price band's coin sits at a FIXED offset and its number is right-
//     aligned to another, so a section's three prices line up as a column
//     instead of three centred groups sliding about with the digit count.
//
// The labelled section headings and the graphs' own numbers are the panel
// carve-out of CLAUDE.md's UI rule, for the reason the practice instruments
// have one: reading a market IS reading numbers, and no shape compares a
// price today against a price yesterday.
//
// It is WIDE AND SHORT, and pinned near the TOP EDGE,
// which is the one piece of this layout that is not taste: the tooltip is
// bottom-left and grows upward off the bottom rim, and a tall centred slab
// puts its own bottom-left corner exactly where a tall tooltip lands - so
// hovering the last row of offers would hide the last row of offers. Its
// HEIGHT is spent against the same rule. The deepest tooltip a well here can
// raise tops out around 192 on the 270-row frame the slab is authored in, and the
// order along the bottom is chosen against that line: the SELL strip ends at
// 190, clear of it, and only the restock road below runs under it - the road,
// whose countdown is deliberately at its RIGHT end where no tooltip reaches.
// So what a tooltip can cover is the wagon, briefly, while you are reading a
// tool - never an offer, a card, the sell target or the clock.
