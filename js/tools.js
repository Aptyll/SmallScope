// The weapon: a TOOL on the ONE weapon slot, loaded with BITS that say what
// it fires. A tool is a body - how often it can shoot, how many bits it holds,
// and how much WEIGHT it can swing in one press; a bit is a shot, or a
// modifier that rewrites every shot fired after it. One press spends the
// tool's strength along the row and looses everything it can afford at once.
// Both are carried items, both scatter out of the world, and a tool keeps its
// bits wherever it goes.
// Keys 1-4 are the class abilities now (js/abilities.js), not slot picks.
// ------------------------------------------------------------ tools & bits
// Ordering: this file needs ITEMS (js/player.js) and RES_COLORS
// (js/structures.js) at LOAD time - it registers one ITEMS entry per tool and
// per bit so the bag, the drop pickup, the death spill and the refusal flash
// are all generic over the new items exactly as they are over a berry. It
// loads after js/actions.js because the shot it spawns is the arrow pipeline's
// and it reads that file's tuning (BOW_Y, AMBUSH_MUL) at runtime.

// ---- tiers ---------------------------------------------------------------
// A tier is a colour and nothing else in the sim: what a tier BUYS you is
// written into each tool's numbers. The plate is the colour behind the icon -
// the one place tier is stated, in every well the item ever sits in (bag cell,
// tool slot, bit cell, loadout card), which is why nothing has to say "TIER 2".
// The top tier is the only one that moves: a shine sweeps its plate.
const TOOL_TIERS = [
  { name: 'WORN',   plate: '#33241a', rim: '#a3794f', ink: '#d9ad72' },
  { name: 'KEEN',   plate: '#14303f', rim: '#7ac0e8', ink: '#bfe6ff' },
  { name: 'GILDED', plate: '#3a2c0e', rim: '#f2cc6a', ink: '#fff2c0' },
];
const TIER_SHINE = 2; // the tier whose plate animates

// ---- bits ----------------------------------------------------------------
// Two kinds under one table, told apart by `proj`.
//
// EVERY bit carries a `weight`, projectile and modifier alike, because weight
// is what a press SPENDS. A tool's `tensile` is a BUDGET reset at the top of
// every activation and spent cell by cell in order (toolPlan below), so a
// heavy bit is not dead weight any more - it is expensive, and what it costs
// is whatever is stacked after it.
//
// A PROJECTILE bit is one shot: `path` is how it flies, `solid` whether a wall stops it, `ff`
// whether it will hurt your own side, `kb` how hard it shoves whatever it
// lands on, and life/speed/dmg are the baselines the
// tool, the champion kit, the hero level and any modifier bits scale - and
// the DRAW scales all three again (`the draw` below). A spent shot is gone:
// nothing lands in the snow to be picked back up, and the tool's own cycle
// is the only thing between one press and the next.
// UNITS: `life` is seconds and `speed` px/s, because that is what the sim runs
// in and what every hit test downstream reads. A tool's `rof` is the one
// number counted in game STEPS, since it is a cadence rather than a physical
// quantity - toolRof() is the single place that converts it.
//
// KNOCKBACK (`kb`) is a MULTIPLIER, not a speed: 1 is the ordinary shove a
// blow lands and the bit scales it. It has to be a multiplier, because the
// three kinds of unit are already shoved at three different weights (a player
// at HIT_KB, a worker at ROBOT_KB, an animal on a curve off the draw) and one
// number written on a bit has to mean the same thing thrown at any of them -
// so it rides to hurtUnit as `kbMul` and scales whatever shove that kind
// takes. A shot with no `kb` at all pushes exactly as hard as it always did.
//
// Four optional fields under those: `reach` is extra px on every hit test (a
// body wider than a shaft's tip - the fist and the axe), `body` names the
// silhouette the shots pass draws it with (BIT_BODY, js/render.js; absent =
// the arrow), `impact` what it DOES where it lands on something rather than
// simply running out (BIT_IMPACT below), and `bot: false` marks a bit no AI
// player can read, the way the paths it cannot aim are already left alone.
//
// `price` is what the merchant sells one for (the `shop` banner, js/shop.js),
// and half of it is what the merchant pays for one back. It is the only
// number on a bit the sim never reads - loot does not consult it and a found
// bit is worth exactly what a bought one is.
//
// A MODIFIER bit (`proj: false`) never flies, but it costs weight like
// everything else. Its `mod(m)` edits the shot envelope - and it edits it for
// every projectile AFTER it in the list and for NONE before it, so where a
// modifier sits is the whole of what it is worth, and a FLAME in the LAST cell
// sets nothing alight. Once a press has reached a modifier it stays in the
// envelope for the rest of that press: there is no per-shot expiry. The shelf
// draws that reach as a rail running forward off the fitting (js/ui.js).
//
// A MOD COMPOUNDS WITH WHAT IS ALREADY IN THE ENVELOPE. Every `mod` must
// COMPOSE with the value it is handed - `*=` a multiplier, `+=` a quantity -
// and must never `=` or `Math.max` it: two SPEEDUPs are four times the speed,
// two FLAMEs burn twice as long at twice the rate, two SPLITTERs are nine
// shots. That is the rule EVERY new modifier follows, and it is why the fold
// is a forward walk rather than a set-union. The one field that is set rather
// than composed is `m.type`, because a damage type is a category and not a
// magnitude.
//
// FIRE is the one damage TYPE a bit can put on a shot (`m.type`, DMG_TYPES in
// js/actions.js): the hit ignites what it lands on, which then burns for
// `m.burn` seconds at `m.burnDps` a second - on a rival, a deer or a worker
// bot alike, because a burn is a unit state like any other.
//
// `path` is one of: 'line' straight | 'zig' weaving | 'orbit' circling the
// shooter | 'boomer' out and back | 'lob' a heavy throw that arcs down |
// 'curve' a scything arc, the way a thrown axe goes.
//
// The swung pair's flight, in seconds - declared above the table because the
// table reads it at LOAD time (PYRE_T and the rest sit under it, read inside
// a closure). It is SHORT on purpose: a fifth of a second at 300 px/s is a
// body length of travel, so the fist and the axe read as a blow thrown from
// where you stand rather than as anything in flight. They are projectiles
// only because a projectile is what the one weapon slot fires.

// never jams it - it truncates it, and what falls off the end is whatever was
// hung last. Everything a press can afford leaves in the SAME frame: a tool
// whose budget covers all of it fires all of it at once.
//
// A MODIFIER APPLIES FORWARD AND ONLY FORWARD. Each projectile is fired
// through a SNAPSHOT of the envelope as it stood when that cell was reached,
// which is what makes "put the FLAME under the arrow" a real decision - and
// once a modifier is in the envelope it stays there for every shot after it
// in the same press. Two of a kind compound, because every `mod` composes
// with what it is handed (see BITS above).
//
// A shot also carries `mods`: the CELLS whose fittings shaped it, snapshotted
// beside the envelope they wrote. Nothing in the sim reads it - it is what the
// shelf draws its rails from (drawShelf, js/ui.js), so the picture of which
