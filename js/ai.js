// Bots. A bot only ever writes the same input struct a human fills in -
// movement axis, aim point, fire / work / slide / dodge and the odd build
// order - so it can never do anything a player couldn't. The brain is a small
// priority ladder, re-picked a few times a second: eat, fight, wolves, defend
// the bird, push the rival bird, escort, hunt, loot, spend, harvest, roam -
// and a PROFILE (the difficulty banner below) says how well each rung is
// played. Every walk goes through steerTo(), which routes
// around obstacles (see pathfinding) and reports an unreachable goal as -1 -
// that, not a timer, is what makes a bot drop a target.

// ---- difficulty ----------------------------------------------------------
// Every bot plays the same ladder; a PROFILE says how well. The RIVALS run
// AI_LEVELS[settings.aiLevel] (class select's notches, remembered with the
// profile); your ALLIES run one notch above the rivals (capped at the top)
// plus the support fields, so your side is always the more competent one
// and the difficulty is how good the other side is. Nothing in a profile
// lets a bot do what a hand cannot - every field is a worse or better use
// of the same input struct:
//   sight   px it notices a rival from (through seenAt, so cover still works);
//           scaled 4/3 with the 640x360 frame (3.22) so a bot keeps the same
//           share of what a screen shows a hand
//   react   s a rival stays noticed before the bot turns on it
//   aim     px of scatter on the aim point, re-rolled every AI_AIM_T
//   lead    0..1 of the target's motion it aims ahead by (flight time)
//   draw    fraction of bowCharge it looses at (a short draw is a weak shot)
//   dodge   x the chance per second it rolls when hurt
//   abil    chance each AI_ABIL_T tick that a ready ability is spent
//   flee    hp fraction under which it hides (hunter) / gives ground
//   work    duty cycle of the E key while harvesting (its level pace)
//   strafe  fraction of each 2 s it keeps moving in a fight; the rest it
//           PLANTS - stands, draws and shoots, the only time a slow side
//           fires - so the moment it stops is the moment it is about to
//           shoot, and the moment a new player hits it. Under 1 it also
//           circles that much less: it walks in straighter
//   pick    'near' the closest rival, 'weak' the one with the least hp
//   push    { t, n } - after t s, the side's first n bots go for the rival
//           eagle (the objective rung), one more every AI_ESCALATE s after
//           that, so a stalemate always breaks
//   guard   how many of the next bots stand by their own bird from 0.6 t on
//   support allies only: escort the human and join their fights and pushes
// What is NOT in a profile: answering a hit on its own bird. At every level
// a struck roost, or a rival seen standing off it, is answered from anywhere
// on the map by as many bots as the threat calls for (the two birds, below)
