// ------------------------------------------------------------ eagle drop
// Nobody spawns in a camp: after PLAY's count each TEAM rides its own armoured
// eagle down the map's one DIAGONAL - RED flies it from the top-right corner
// to roost in the BOTTOM-LEFT woods, BLUE the other way to the TOP-RIGHT,
// every match and every seed - each keeping EAGLE_LANE to its own right so
// the pass mid-route is a clean fly-by (mode 'drop'). The view zooms out to
// DROP_ZOOM, the flight path is dotted across the snow itself (M raises the
// world map for the wider read), and a rider jumps with Space/Enter/E/click -
// but only inside the JUMP WINDOW: the line's last DROP_LOCK_T seconds, gold
// on the flight bar and on the dotted line both (bots jump at their own
// hashed fraction of the window). A jumper free-falls for FALL_T onto the
// nearest open tile, which becomes its spawn tile (the bot brain's home); the
// human's landing snaps the view back to the player's own zoom and runs the
// HUD slide-in. A rider who never jumps RIDES THE LANDING: the bird dives
// with them on its back, the crash hands the mode over (landAboard), the drop
// brief tours both roosts with them still seated, and then E (or the roll
// button - a pad's A) hops them off (hopOff, under the HOP OFF indicator
// drawHopPrompt raises, which wears the button of the controller in hand). A profile's
// very first flight is exactly that ride - its manual jump is refused - so a
// new player's first ground is the roost, beside the merchant and the gate.
// state.drop outlives mode 'drop' - and the whole match: past the
// line's end each bird dives into the corner's treeline, blows a crater in
// the trees, its MERCHANT (the driver on its neck - the `merchant` banner,
// js/robots.js) hops off to fell the rim and raise a gate, a LANE of pines
// falls one by one from the crater out to the open snow (the parkour roll's
// felling front), and the bird sits there as its team's OBJECTIVE - guarding
// itself with a wing gust and calming back down (preen regen) between scares.
// Keep its nerve up: at zero the bird is DRIVEN OFF (hurtEagle / eagleFlee),
// and its whole side falls with it.
