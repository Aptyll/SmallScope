// ---- inventory: the backpack ---------------------------------------------
// Gold is a wallet number and never a bag item - it is currency, and a purse
// that could run out of room would make a kill refuse its own bounty. What
// you CARRY lives in slots instead: `p.bag` is a fixed array of `p.bagCap`
// cells, each one null or a { type, n } stack of at most ITEMS[type].stack.
// The slot is the unit of capacity for everything the bag holds, so two half
// stacks cost two cells the way they do in any RPG bag, and the pickup path
// can genuinely refuse a find when there is nowhere to put it - which is the
// whole reason the bag is slots and not a row of counters. What that
// capacity is FOR is the build: tools, bits and unopened cards, the things a
// player lays out, compares and chooses between.
//
// A cell may also be INSTANCED: a tool's cell carries the bits loaded into it
// (`bits`, `idx` - see js/tools.js), which is why a tool stacks to 1 and is
// moved with bagPut() rather than rebuilt from a type name. Nothing else in
// the bag has state of its own.
//

// `p.food`, a set of uncapped counters beside the wallet, and takes no cell:
// the two meals are pressed on Q and F from the hud strip's own buttons, and
// an unopened card (3.23) is DRAWN on the card key from the strip's card
// button - one at random from everything held, its buff picked at random
// (useCard, js/core.js) - so none of them is ever laid out, compared or
// dragged, and every cell one of them took was a cell taken off the build.
// The six helpers below route them there, which is what keeps the pickup, the
// catch, the sale, the AI's food check and the death spill generic over "a
// berry" and "a bit" alike.
