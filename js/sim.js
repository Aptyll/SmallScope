// ------------------------------------------------------------ wind
// One wind field, and everything the weather moves reads it: the snow's drift,
// and how far over every pine on the field is leaning (treeFrame,
// js/draw-world.js). It is not one number and it is not one wave: a single
// travelling sine over the tile grid is a marching stripe, and a forest does
// not do that. What crosses the field is a SUM OF WAVES on different bearings,
// the way an ocean surface is - three fast ripples carrying the rustle, under a
// two-wave gust envelope deciding where the air is actually moving at all. No
// period here is a multiple of another, so no two crests ever meet twice in the
// same place and the pattern over the treeline never repeats. It dies with the
// light: windAmp() squares the daylight, so the air goes still over dusk and by
// full dark every tree is standing in its own rest pose.
//
// What the field hands back is a SIGNED LEAN, not a phase - a pine's frames are
// a ladder from thrown-left to thrown-right - and that is what lets a gust read
// as a body of moving air instead of a shimmer. Three things make it read that
// way, and they are the three terms of windSway():
//
//   the LEAN     air pushes one way. A stand inside a gust is bent downwind and
//                held there for as long as the gust is on it, which is the part
//                you actually watch cross the treeline; it eases back upright
//                in the lull behind. This is the DC term, and the reason the
//                field is signed rather than an amplitude. Which way is downwind
//                VEERS over minutes (windVeer) - so a stand leans left for a
//                while, stands up as the air swings, then leans right - and it
//                is one answer for the whole map, because a prevailing wind is
//                a property of the day and not of a tile.
//   the RUSTLE   the crowns work about that lean, and only as hard as the air
//                on them - it is multiplied by the same gust, so a tree in a
//                lull barely stirs while one in the front is thrashing. It is
//                small enough against the lean that a gusted tree stays
//                downwind of vertical, the way a real one does.
//   the ARRIVAL  a gust is not a sine. It hits in about a third of its cycle
//                and takes the other two thirds to let go, so the envelope's
//                waves are SKEWED (wskew) rather than plain. That asymmetry is
//                most of what separates a front arriving from the whole forest
//                breathing in and out.
//
// A wave is (kx, ky) rad per TILE - the bearing is the vector and its length is
// the wavelength - plus rad/s of travel and a share of the amplitude. The three
// ripple bearings are deliberately spread: two run with the prevailing
// down-right air, the third cuts across it, and that crossing is what breaks a
// front into patches instead of bands.
// The amplitudes deliberately sum past 1: three waves at random phase mostly
// cancel, so a set that summed to exactly 1 would leave the forest permanently
// half-hearted. At 1.44 the ordinary rustle is a quiver of a frame or two and a
// gust that lands all three crests together throws that crown right over.
